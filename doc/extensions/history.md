# History

[![Tests](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim/actions)

The [History extension](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim) for CodeCompanion provides persistent chat history management, allowing you to save, browse, and restore chat sessions across Neovim restarts. It includes automatic title generation and flexible storage options.

## Features

- üíæ Flexible chat saving:
  - Automatic session saving (can be disabled)
  - Manual save with dedicated keymap
- üéØ Smart title generation for chats
- üîÑ Continue from where you left
- üìö Browse saved chats with preview
- üîç Multiple picker interfaces
- ‚åõ Optional automatic chat expiration
- ‚ö° Restore chat sessions with full context and tools state
- üè¢ **Project-aware filtering**: Filter chats by workspace/project context
- üìã **Chat duplication**: Easily duplicate chats to create variations or backups

The following CodeCompanion features are preserved when saving and restoring chats:

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
|  System Prompts | ‚úÖ  | System prompt used in the chat |
|  Messages History | ‚úÖ  | All messages |
|  Images | ‚úÖ  | Restores images as base64 strings |
|  LLM Adapter | ‚úÖ  | The specific adapter used for the chat |
|  LLM Settings | ‚úÖ  | Model, temperature and other adapter settings |
|  Tools | ‚úÖ  | Tool schemas and their system prompts |
|  Tool Outputs | ‚úÖ  | Tool execution results |
|  Variables | ‚úÖ  | Variables used in the chat |
|  References | ‚úÖ  | Code snippets and command outputs added via slash commands |
|  Pinned References | ‚úÖ  | Pinned references |
|  Watchers | ‚ö†  | Saved but requires original buffer context to resume watching |

When restoring a chat:
1. The complete message history is recreated
2. All tools and references are reinitialized
3. Original LLM settings and adapter are restored
4. Previous system prompts are preserved

> **Note**: While watched buffer states are saved, they require the original buffer context to resume watching functionality.

> [!NOTE]
> As this is an extension that deeply integrates with CodeCompanion's internal APIs, occasional compatibility issues may arise when CodeCompanion updates. If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim/issues) to help us maintain compatibility.

## Installation

First, install the plugin

```lua
{
    "olimorris/codecompanion.nvim",
    dependencies = {
        --other plugins
        "ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim"
    }
}
```

For detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim#installation).

Next, register history as an extension in your CodeCompanion config:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
    extensions = {
        history = {
            enabled = true,
            opts = {
                -- Keymap to open history from chat buffer (default: gh)
                keymap = "gh",
                -- Keymap to save the current chat manually (when auto_save is disabled)
                save_chat_keymap = "sc",
                -- Save all chats by default (disable to save only manually using 'sc')
                auto_save = true,
                -- Number of days after which chats are automatically deleted (0 to disable)
                expiration_days = 0,
                -- Picker interface ("telescope" or "snacks" or "fzf-lua" or "default")
                picker = "telescope",
                -- Customize picker keymaps (optional)
                picker_keymaps = {
                    rename = { n = "r", i = "<M-r>" },
                    delete = { n = "d", i = "<M-d>" },
                    duplicate = { n = "<C-y>", i = "<C-y>" },
                },
                ---Automatically generate titles for new chats
                auto_generate_title = true,
                title_generation_opts = {
                    ---Adapter for generating titles (defaults to active chat's adapter) 
                    adapter = nil, -- e.g "copilot"
                    ---Model for generating titles (defaults to active chat's model)
                    model = nil, -- e.g "gpt-4o"
                    ---Number of user prompts after which to refresh the title (0 to disable)
                    refresh_every_n_prompts = 0, -- e.g., 3 to refresh after every 3rd user prompt
                    ---Maximum number of times to refresh the title (default: 3)
                    max_refreshes = 3,
                },
                ---On exiting and entering neovim, loads the last chat on opening chat
                continue_last_chat = false,
                ---When chat is cleared with `gx` delete the chat from history
                delete_on_clearing_chat = false,
                ---Directory path to save the chats
                dir_to_save = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/codecompanion-history",
                ---Enable detailed logging for history extension
                enable_logging = false,
                ---Optional filter function to control which chats are shown when browsing
                chat_filter = nil, -- function(chat_data) return boolean end
            }
        }
    }
})
```

## Usage 

#### üéØ Commands

- `:CodeCompanionHistory` - Open the history browser

#### ‚å®Ô∏è Chat Buffer Keymaps

- `gh` - Open history browser (customizable via `opts.keymap`)
- `sc` - Save current chat manually (customizable via `opts.save_chat_keymap`)

#### üìö History Browser

The history browser shows all your saved chats with:
- Title (auto-generated or custom)
- Last updated time  
- Preview of chat contents

Actions in history browser:
- `<CR>` - Open selected chat
- Normal mode:
  - `d` - Delete selected chat(s)
  - `r` - Rename selected chat
  - `<C-y>` - Duplicate selected chat
- Insert mode:
  - `<M-d>` (Alt+d) - Delete selected chat(s)
  - `<M-r>` (Alt+r) - Rename selected chat
  - `<C-y>` - Duplicate selected chat

You can use `<Tab>` to select multiple chats for deletion.

> Note: Delete, rename, and duplicate actions are only available in telescope, snacks, and fzf-lua pickers. Multiple chats can be selected for deletion using picker's multi-select feature. Duplication is limited to one chat at a time.

#### üîß API

The history extension exports the following functions that can be accessed via `require("codecompanion").extensions.history`:

```lua
-- Get the storage location for saved chats
get_location(): string?

-- Save a chat to storage (uses last chat if none provided)
save_chat(chat?: CodeCompanion.Chat)

-- Browse chats with custom filter function
browse_chats(filter_fn?: function(ChatIndexData): boolean)

-- Get metadata for all saved chats with optional filtering
get_chats(filter_fn?: function(ChatIndexData): boolean): table<string, ChatIndexData>

-- Load a specific chat by its save_id
load_chat(save_id: string): ChatData?

-- Delete a chat by its save_id
delete_chat(save_id: string): boolean

-- Duplicate a chat by its save_id
duplicate_chat(save_id: string, new_title?: string): string?
```

Example usage:

```lua
local history = require("codecompanion").extensions.history

-- Browse chats with project filter
history.browse_chats(function(chat_data)
    return chat_data.project_root == utils.find_project_root()
end)

-- Get all saved chats metadata
local chats = history.get_chats()

-- Load a specific chat
local chat_data = history.load_chat("some_save_id")

-- Delete a chat
history.delete_chat("some_save_id")

-- Duplicate a chat with custom title
local new_save_id = history.duplicate_chat("some_save_id", "My Custom Copy")

-- Duplicate a chat with auto-generated title (appends "(1)")
local new_save_id = history.duplicate_chat("some_save_id")
```
