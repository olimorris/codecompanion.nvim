> [!NOTE]
> As this is an extension that deeply integrates with CodeCompanion's internal APIs, occasional compatibility issues may arise when CodeCompanion updates. If you encounter any bugs or unexpected behavior, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim/issues) to help us maintain compatibility.

## Installation

First, install the plugin

```lua
{
    "olimorris/codecompanion.nvim",
    dependencies = {
        --other plugins
        "ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim"
    }
}
```

For detailed information, please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/ravitemer/codecompanion-history.nvim#installation).

Next, register history as an extension in your CodeCompanion config:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
    extensions = {
        history = {
            enabled = true,
            opts = {
                -- Keymap to open history from chat buffer (default: gh)
                keymap = "gh",
                -- Keymap to save the current chat manually (when auto_save is disabled)
                save_chat_keymap = "sc",
                -- Save all chats by default (disable to save only manually using 'sc')
                auto_save = true,
                -- Number of days after which chats are automatically deleted (0 to disable)
                expiration_days = 0,
                -- Picker interface ("telescope" or "snacks" or "fzf-lua" or "default")
                picker = "telescope",
                ---Automatically generate titles for new chats
                auto_generate_title = true,
                title_generation_opts = {
                    ---Adapter for generating titles (defaults to active chat's adapter) 
                    adapter = nil, -- e.g "copilot"
                    ---Model for generating titles (defaults to active chat's model)
                    model = nil, -- e.g "gpt-4o"
                },
                ---On exiting and entering neovim, loads the last chat on opening chat
                continue_last_chat = false,
                ---When chat is cleared with `gx` delete the chat from history
                delete_on_clearing_chat = false,
                ---Directory path to save the chats
                dir_to_save = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/codecompanion-history",
                ---Enable detailed logging for history extension
                enable_logging = false,
            }
        }
    }
})
```
