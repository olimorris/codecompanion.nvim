# Getting Started

## Configuring an Adapter

> [!NOTE]
> The adapters that the plugin supports out of the box can be found [here](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/lua/codecompanion/adapters)

An adapter is what connects Neovim to an LLM. It's the interface that allows data to be sent, received and processed. In order to use the plugin, you need to make sure you've configured an adapter first:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  strategies = {
    chat = {
      adapter = "anthropic",
    },
    inline = {
      adapter = "anthropic",
    },
  },
}),
```
In the example above, we're using the Anthropic adapter for both the chat and inline strategies.

Because most LLMs require an API key you'll need to share that with the adapter. By default, adapters will look in your environment for a `*_API_KEY` where `*` is the name of the adapter e.g. `ANTHROPIC` or `OPENAI`. However, you can extend the adapter and change the API key like so:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    anthropic = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("anthropic", {
        env = {
          api_key = "MY_OTHER_ANTHROPIC_KEY"
        },
      })
    end,
  },
}),
```

Having API keys in plain text in your shell is not always safe. Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/pull/24), you can run commands from within your config by prefixing them with `cmd:`. In the example below, we're using the 1Password CLI to read an OpenAI credential.

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    openai = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("openai", {
        env = {
          api_key = "cmd:op read op://personal/OpenAI/credential --no-newline",
        },
      })
    end,
  },
}),
```

## Chat Buffer

<p align="center">

</p>

The Chat Buffer is where you can converse with an LLM from within Neovim. It operates on a single response per turn, basis.

Run `:CodeCompanionChat` to open a chat buffer. Type your prompt and press `<CR>`. Or, run `:CodeCompanionChat why are Lua and Neovim so perfect together?` to send a prompt directly to the chat buffer. Toggle the chat buffer with `:CodeCompanionChat Toggle`.

You can add context from your code base by using _Variables_ and _Slash Commands_ in the chat buffer.

### Variables

_Variables_, accessed via `#`, contain data about the present state of Neovim:

- `#buffer` - Shares the current buffer's code. You can also specify line numbers with `#buffer:8-20`
- `#lsp` - Shares LSP information and code for the current buffer
- `#viewport` - Shares the buffers and lines that you see in the Neovim viewport

### Slash Commands

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These have been designed to work with native Neovim completions alongside nvim-cmp and blink.cmp. To open the native completion menu use `<C-_>` in insert mode when in the chat buffer.

_Slash commands_, accessed via `/`, run commands to insert additional context into the chat buffer:

- `/buffer` - Insert open buffers
- `/fetch` - Insert URL contents
- `/file` - Insert a file
- `/help` - Insert content from help tags
- `/now` - Insert the current date and time
- `/symbols` - Insert symbols from a selected file
- `/terminal` - Insert terminal output

### Agents / Tools

_Tools_, accessed via `@`, allow the LLM to function as an agent and carry out actions:

- `@cmd_runner` - The LLM will run shell commands (subject to approval)
- `@editor` - The LLM will edit code in a Neovim buffer
- `@files` -  The LLM will can work with files on the file system (subject to approval)
- `@rag` - The LLM will browse and search the internet for real-time information to supplement its response

Tools can also be grouped together to form _Agents_, which are also accessed via `@` in the chat buffer:

- `@full_stack_dev` - Contains the `cmd_runner`, `editor` and `files` tools.

## Inline Assistant

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21568a7f-aea8-4928-b3d4-f39c6566a23c" alt="Inline Assistant">
</p>

> [!NOTE]
> The diff provider in the video is [mini.diff](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.diff)

The Inline Assistant enables an LLM to write code directly into a Neovim buffer.

Run `:CodeCompanion <your prompt>` to call the Inline Assistant. The Assistant will evaluate the prompt and either write code or open a chat buffer. You can also make a visual selection and call the Assistant.

The Assistant has knowledge of your last conversation from a chat buffer. A prompt such as `:CodeCompanion add the new function here` will see the Assistant add a code block directly into the current buffer.

For convenience, you can call prompts from the [prompt library](/configuration/prompt-library) via the Assistant such as `:'<,'>CodeCompanion /buffer what does this file do?`. The prompt library comes with the following defaults:

- `/buffer` - Send the current buffer to the LLM alongside a prompt
- `/commit` - Generate a commit message
- `/explain` - Explain how selected code in a buffer works
- `/fix` - Fix the selected code
- `/lsp` - Explain the LSP diagnostics for the selected code
- `/tests` - Generate unit tests for selected code

## Commands

Use CodeCompanion to create Neovim commands in command-line mode (`:h Command-line`) via `:CodeCompanionCmd <your prompt>`.

## Action Palette

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d427d6d-aa5f-405c-ba14-583830251740" alt="Action Palette">
</p>

Run `:CodeCompanionActions` to open the action palette, which gives you access to all functionality of the plugin. By default the plugin uses `vim.ui.select`, however, you can change the provider by altering the `display.action_palette.provider` config value to be `telescope` or `mini_pick`. You can also call the Telescope extension with `:Telescope codecompanion`.

> [!NOTE]
> Some actions and prompts will only be visible if you're in _Visual mode_.

## List of Commands

The plugin has three core commands:

- `CodeCompanion` - Open the inline assistant
- `CodeCompanionChat` - Open a chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionCmd` - Generate a command in the command-liine
- `CodeCompanionActions` - Open the _Action Palette_

However, there are multiple options available:

- `CodeCompanion <your prompt>` - Prompt the inline assistant
- `CodeCompanion /<prompt library>` - Use the [prompt library](configuration/prompt-library) with the inline assistant e.g. `/commit`
- `CodeCompanionChat <prompt>` - Send a prompt to the LLM via a chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChat <adapter>` - Open a chat buffer with a specific adapter
- `CodeCompanionChat Toggle` - Toggle a chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChat Add` - Add visually selected chat to the current chat buffer

## Suggested Plugin Workflow

For an optimum plugin workflow, I recommend the following:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap({ "n", "v" }, "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap({ "n", "v" }, "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionChat Toggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "ga", "<cmd>CodeCompanionChat Add<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Expand 'cc' into 'CodeCompanion' in the command line
vim.cmd([[cab cc CodeCompanion]])
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also assign prompts from the library to specific mappings. See the [prompt library](configuration/prompt-library) section for more information.
