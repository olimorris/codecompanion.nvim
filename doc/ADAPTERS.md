# Adapters

In CodeCompanion, adapters are interfaces that act as a bridge between the plugin's functionality and an LLM. All adapters must follow the interface, below.

This guide is intended to serve as a reference for anyone who wishes to contribute an adapter to the plugin or understand the inner workings of existing adapters.

## The Interface

Let's take a look at the interface of an adapter as per the `adapter.lua` file:

```lua
---@class CodeCompanion.Adapter
---@field name string The name of the adapter
---@field roles table The mapping of roles in the config to the LLM's defined roles
---@field url string The URL of the LLM to connect to
---@field env? table Environment variables which can be referenced in the parameters
---@field env_replaced? table Replacement of environment variables with their actual values
---@field headers table The headers to pass to the request
---@field parameters table The parameters to pass to the request
---@field raw? table Any additional curl arguments to pass to the request
---@field opts? table Additional options for the adapter
---@field handlers table Functions which link the output from the request to CodeCompanion
---@field handlers.setup? fun()
---@field handlers.form_parameters fun()
---@field handlers.form_messages fun()
---@field handlers.chat_output fun()
---@field handlers.inline_output fun()
---@field handlers.on_stdout fun()
---@field handlers.teardown? fun()
---@field schema table Set of parameters for the LLM that the user can customise in the chat buffer
```

Everything up to the handlers should be self-explanatory. We're simply providing details of the LLM's API to the curl library and executing the request. The real intelligence of the adapter comes from the handlers table which is a set of functions which bridge the functionality of the plugin to the LLM.

## Environment Variables

When building an adapter, you'll need to inject variables into different parts of the adapter class. If we take the [Google Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/rest/Streaming_REST.ipynb) endpoint as an example, we need to inject the model and API key variables into the URL of `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/${model}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse&key=${api_key}`. Whereas with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication), we need an `Authorization` http header to contain our API key.

Let's take a look at the `env` table from the Google Gemini adapter that comes with the plugin:

```lua
url = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/${model}:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse&key=${api_key}",
env = {
  api_key = "GEMINI_API_KEY",
  model = "schema.model.default",
},
```

The key `api_key` represents the name of the variable which can be injected in the adapter, and the value can represent one of:

- A command to execute on the user's system
- An environment variable from the user's system
- A function to be executed at runtime
- A path to an item in the adapter's schema table
- A plain text value

> [!NOTE]
> Environment variables can be injected into the `url`, `headers` and `parameters` fields of the adapter class at runtime

**Commands**

An environment variable can be obtained from running a command on a user's system. This can be accomplished by prefixing the value with `cmd:` such as:

```lua
env = {
  api_key = "cmd:op read op://personal/Gemini_API/credential --no-newline",
},
```

In this example, we're running the `op read` command to get a credential from 1Password.

**Environment Variable**

An environment variable can also be obtained by using lua's `os.getenv` function. Simply enter the name of the variable as a string such as:

```lua
env = {
  api_key = "GEMINI_API_KEY",
},
```

**Functions**

An environment variable can also be resolved via the use of a function such as:

```lua
env = {
  api_key = function()
    return os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")
  end,
},
```

**Schema Values**

An environment variable can also be resolved by entering the path to a value in a table on the adapter class. For example:

```lua
env = {
  model = "schema.model.default",
},
```

In this example, we're getting the value of a user's chosen model from the schema table on the adapter.

## Handlers

Currently, the handlers table requires five functions to be implemented:

- `form_parameters` - A function which can be used to set the parameters of the request
- `form_messages` - _Most_ LLMs have a `messages` array in the body of the request which contains the conversation. This function can be used to format and structure that array
- `chat_output` - A function to format the output of the request into a Lua table that plugin can parse for the chat buffer
- `inline_output` - A function to format the output of the request into a Lua table that plugin can parse, inline, to the current buffer
- `on_stdout` - A function which is used to handle any errors returned from the LLM

There are three optional handlers which you can make use of:

- `tokens` - A function to determine the amount of tokens consumed in the request(s)
- `setup` - The function which is called before anything else
- `teardown` - A function which is called last and after the request has completed

Let's take a look at a real world example of how we've implemented the OpenAI adapter.

> [!TIP]
> All of the adapters in the plugin come with their own tests. These serve as a great reference to understand how they're working with the output of the API

### OpenAI's API Output

If we reference the OpenAI [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api) we can see that they require the messages to be in an array which consists of `role` and `content`:

```sh
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Explain Ruby in two words"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Chat Buffer Output

The chat buffer, which is structured like:

```markdown
## Me

Explain Ruby in two words
```

results in the following output:

```lua
{
  {
    role = "user",
    content = "Explain Ruby in two words"
  }
}
```

### `form_messages`

The chat buffer's output is passed to this handler in for the form of the `messages` parameter. So we can just output this as part of a messages table:

```lua
handlers = {
  form_messages = function(self, messages)
    return { messages = messages }
  end,
}
```

### `chat_output`

Now let's look at how we format the output from OpenAI. Running that request results in:

```sh
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-90DdmqMKOKpqFemxX0OhTVdH042gu","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1709839462,"model":"gpt-4-0125-preview","system_fingerprint":"fp_70b2088885","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}
```

```sh
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-90DdmqMKOKpqFemxX0OhTVdH042gu","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1709839462,"model":"gpt-4-0125-preview","system_fingerprint":"fp_70b2088885","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Programming"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}
```

```sh
data: {"id":"chatcmpl-90DdmqMKOKpqFemxX0OhTVdH042gu","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1709839462,"model":"gpt-4-0125-preview","system_fingerprint":"fp_70b2088885","choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":" language"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]},
```

```sh
data: [DONE]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that the `chat_output` handler requires a table containing `status` and `output` to be returned.

Remember that we're streaming from the API so the request comes through in batches. Thankfully the client implementation handles this and we just have to handle formatting the output into the chat buffer.

The first thing to note with streaming endpoints is that they don't return valid JSON. In this case, the output is prefixed with `data: `. So let's remove it:

```lua
handlers = {
  chat_output = function(data)
    data = data:sub(7)
  end
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The data passed to the `chat_output` handler is the response from OpenAI

We can then decode the JSON using native vim functions:

```lua
handlers = {
  chat_output = function(data)
    data = data:sub(7)
    local ok, json = pcall(vim.json.decode, data, { luanil = { object = true } })
  end
}
```

We want to include any nil values so we pass in `luanil = { object = true }`.

Examining the output of the API, we see that the streamed data is stored in a `choices[1].delta` table. That's easy to pickup:

```lua
handlers = {
  chat_output = function(data)
    ---
    local delta = json.choices[1].delta
  end
}
```

and we can then access the new streamed data that we want to write into the chat buffer, with:

```lua
handlers = {
  chat_output = function(data)
    local output = {}
    ---
    local delta = json.choices[1].delta

    if delta.content then
      output.content = delta.content
      output.role = delta.role or nil
    end
  end
}
```

And then we can return the output in the following format:

```lua
handlers = {
  chat_output = function(data)
    --
    return {
      status = "success",
      output = output,
    }
  end
}
```

Now if we put it all together, and put some checks in place to make sure that we have data in our response:

```lua
handlers = {
  chat_output = function(data)
    local output = {}

    if data and data ~= "" then
      data = data:sub(7)
      local ok, json = pcall(vim.json.decode, data, { luanil = { object = true } })

      local delta = json.choices[1].delta

      if delta.content then
        output.content = delta.content
        output.role = delta.role or nil

        return {
          status = "success",
          output = output,
        }
      end
    end
  end
},
```

### `form_parameters`

For the purposes of the OpenAI adapter, no additional parameters need to be created. So we just pass this through:

```lua
handlers = {
  form_parameters = function(self, params, messages)
    return params
  end,
}
```

### `inline_output`

From a design perspective, the inline strategy is very similar to the chat strategy. With the `inline_output` handler we simply return the content we wish to be streamed into the buffer.

In the case of OpenAI, once we've checked the data we have back from the LLM and parsed it as JSON, we simply need to:

```lua
---Output the data from the API ready for inlining into the current buffer
---@param data table The streamed JSON data from the API, also formatted by the format_data handler
---@param context table Useful context about the buffer to inline to
---@return string|table|nil
inline_output = function(data, context)
  -- Data cleansed, parsed and validated
  -- ..
  local content = json.choices[1].delta.content
  if content then
    return content
  end
end,
```

The `inline_output` handler also receives context from the buffer that initiated the request.

### `on_stdout`

Handling errors from a streaming endpoint can be challenging. It's recommended that any errors are managed in the `on_stdout` handler which is initiated when the response has completed. In the case of OpenAI, if there is an error, we'll see a response back from the API like:

```sh
data: {
data:     "error": {
data:         "message": "Incorrect API key provided: 1sk-F18b****************************************XdwS. You can find your API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.",
data:         "type": "invalid_request_error",
data:         "param": null,
data:         "code": "invalid_api_key"
data:     }
data: }
```

This would be challenging to parse! Thankfully we can leverage the `on_stdout` handler:

```lua
---Function to catch any errors from the standard output
---@param self CodeCompanion.Adapter
---@param data table
---@return nil
on_stdout = function(self, data)
  local stdout = table.concat(data._stdout_results)

  local ok, json = pcall(vim.json.decode, stdout, { luanil = { object = true } })
  if ok then
    if json.error then
      return log:error("Error: %s", json.error.message)
    end
  end
end,
```

The `log:error` call ensures that any errors are logged to the logfile as well as displayed to the user in Neovim. It's also important to reference that the `chat_output` and `inline_output` handlers need to be able to ignore any errors from the API and let the `on_stdout` handle them.

### `setup` and `teardown`

There are two optional handlers that you can make use of: `setup` and `teardown`.

The `setup` handler will execute before the request is sent to the LLM's endpoint and before the environment variables have been set. This is leveraged in the Copilot adapter to obtain the token before it's resolved as part of the environment variables table. The `setup` handler **must** return a boolean value so the `client.lua` file can determine whether to proceed with the request.

The `teardown` handler will execute once the request has completed and after `on_stdout`.

## Schema

The schema table describes the settings/parameters for the LLM. If the user has `display.chat.show_settings = true` then this table will be exposed at the top of the chat buffer.

We'll explore some of the options in the OpenAI adapter's schema table:

```lua
schema = {
  model = {
    order = 1,
    mapping = "parameters",
    type = "enum",
    desc = "ID of the model to use. See the model endpoint compatibility table for details on which models work with the Chat API.",
    default = "gpt-4o",
    choices = {
      "gpt-4o",
      "gpt-4o-mini",
      "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
      "gpt-4",
      "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    },
  },
}
```

The model key sets out the specific model which is to be used to interact with the OpenAI endpoint. We've listed the default, in this example, as `gpt-4o` but we allow the user to choose from a possible five options, via the `choices` key. We've given this an order value of `1` so that it's always displayed at the top of the chat buffer. We've also given it a useful description as this is used in the virtual text when a user hovers over it. Finally, we've specified that it has a mapping property of `parameters`. This tells the adapter that we wish to map this model key to the parameters part of the HTTP request.

Let's take a look at one more:

```lua
temperature = {
  order = 2,
  mapping = "parameters",
  type = "number",
  optional = true,
  default = 1,
  desc = "What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.",
  validate = function(n)
    return n >= 0 and n <= 2, "Must be between 0 and 2"
  end,
},
```

You'll see we've specified a function call for the `validate` key. We're simply checking that the value of the temperature is between 0 and 2. Again, we'll use virtual text and LSP warnings to alert the user if they've strayed from these constraints.
