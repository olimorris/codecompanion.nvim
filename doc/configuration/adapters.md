An adapter is what connects Neovim to an LLM provider and model. It's the interface that allows data to be sent, received and processed. There are a multitude of ways to customize them.

There are two "types" of adapter in CodeCompanion; **http** adapters which connect you to an LLM and **ACP** adapters which leverage the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) to connect you to an agent.

The configuration for both types of adapters is exactly the same, however they sit within their own tables (`adapters.http.*` and `adapters.acp.*`) and have different options available. HTTP adapters use _models_ to allow users to select the specific LLM they'd like to interact with. ACP adapters use _commands_ to allow users to customize their interaction with agents (e.g. enabling _yolo_ mode).

## Changing the Default Adapter

You can change the default adapter for each strategy as follows:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  strategies = {
    chat = {
      adapter = "anthropic",
    },
    inline = {
      adapter = "copilot",
    },
    cmd = {
      adapter = "deepseek",
    }
  },
}),
```

## Setting an API Key

Extend a base adapter to set options like `api_key` or `model`:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    http = {
      anthropic = function()
        return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("anthropic", {
          env = {
            api_key = "MY_OTHER_ANTHROPIC_KEY",
          },
        })
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

If you do not want to store secrets in plain text, prefix commands with `cmd:`:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    acp = {
      gemini_cli = function()
        return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("gemini_cli", {
          env = {
            api_key = "cmd:op read op://personal/Gemini/credential --no-newline",
          },
        })
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> In this example, we're using the 1Password CLI to extract the Gemini API Key. You could also use gpg as outlined [here](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions/601)

Environment variables can also be functions and as a parameter, they receive a copy of the adapter itself.

## Changing a Model

To more easily change a model for a HTTP adapter, you can pass in the `name` and `model` to the adapter:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  strategies = {
    chat = {
      adapter = {
        name = "copilot",
        model = "claude-sonnet-4",
      },
    },
  },
}),

```

To change the default model on an adapter you can modify the `schema.model.default` property:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    openai = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("openai", {
        schema = {
          model = {
            default = "gpt-4.1",
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
}),
```

## Changing Auth Method of an ACP Adapter

> [!NOTE]
> The auth methods for each ACP adapter are output in the [logs](/configuration/others#log-level) when the `log_level` is set to `DEBUG`.

It's important to note that each agent adapter handles authentication differently. CodeCompanion endeavours to share the available options in the agent's adapter as a comment. However, it's recommended to consult the documentation of the agent you're working with.

An example of changing the Gemini CLI's auth method to use the API key and a 1Password vault:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    acp = {
      gemini_cli = function()
        return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("gemini_cli", {
          defaults = {
            auth_method = "gemini-api-key", -- "oauth-personal"|"gemini-api-key"|"vertex-ai"
          },
          env = {
            GEMINI_API_KEY = "cmd:op read op://personal/Gemini_API/credential --no-newline",
          },
        })
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

## Configuring Adapter Settings

> [!NOTE]
> When extending an adapter with `.extend`, use it's key from the `adapters` dictionary

LLMs have many settings such as model, temperature and max_tokens. In an adapter, these sit within a schema table and can be configured during setup:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    http = {
      qwen3 = function()
        return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("ollama", {
          name = "qwen3", -- Give this adapter a different name to differentiate it from the default ollama adapter
          opts = {
            vision = true,
            stream = true,
          },
          schema = {
            model = {
              default = "qwen3:latest",
            },
            num_ctx = {
              default = 16384,
            },
            think = {
              default = false,
            },
            keep_alive = {
              default = "5m",
            },
          },
        })
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

Or, in the case of an ACP adapter:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    acp = {
      gemini_cli = function()
        return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("gemini_cli", {
          commands = {
            default = {
              "node",
              "/Users/Oli/Code/try/gemini-cli/packages/cli",
              "--experimental-acp",
            },
          },
          defaults = {
            auth_method = "gemini-api-key",
            mcpServers = {},
            timeout = 20000, -- 20 seconds
          },
          env = {
            GEMINI_API_KEY = "GEMINI_API_KEY",
          },
        })
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

## Adding a Custom Adapter

> [!NOTE]
> See the [Creating Adapters](/extending/adapters) section to learn how to create custom adapters

Custom adapters can be added to the plugin as follows:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  http = {
    adapters = {
      my_custom_adapter = function()
        return {} -- My adapter logic
      end,
    },
  },
})
```

## Setting a Proxy

A proxy can be configured by utilising the `adapters.opts` table in the config:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    opts = {
      allow_insecure = true,
      proxy = "socks5://127.0.0.1:9999",
    },
  },
}),
```

## Community Adapters

Thanks to the community for building the following adapters:

- [Venice.ai](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions/972)
- [Fireworks.ai](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions/693)
- [OpenRouter](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions/1013)

The section of the discussion forums which is dedicated to user created adapters can be found [here](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22tip%3A+adapter%22). Use these individual threads as a place to raise issues and ask questions about your specific adapters.

## Hiding Default Adapters

By default, the plugin shows all available adapters, including the defaults. If you prefer to only display the adapters defined in your user configuration, you can set the `show_defaults` option to `false`:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    opts = {
      show_defaults = false,
    },
    -- Define your custom adapters here
  },
})
```

## Controlling Model Choices

When switching between adapters, the plugin typically displays all available model choices for the selected adapter. If you want to simplify the interface and have the default model automatically chosen (without showing any model selection UI), you can set the `show_model_choices` option to `false`:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    opts = {
      show_model_choices = false,
    },
    -- Define your custom adapters here
  },
})
```

With `show_model_choices = false`, the default model (as defined in the adapter's schema) will be automatically selected when changing adapters, and no model selection will be shown to the user.

## Example: Using Ollama Remotely

To use Ollama remotely, change the URL in the env table, set an API key and pass it via an "Authorization" header:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    ollama = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("ollama", {
        env = {
          url = "https://my_ollama_url",
          api_key = "OLLAMA_API_KEY",
        },
        headers = {
          ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
          ["Authorization"] = "Bearer ${api_key}",
        },
        parameters = {
          sync = true,
        },
      })
    end,
  },
})
```

## Example: Azure OpenAI

Below is an example of how you can leverage the `azure_openai` adapter within the plugin:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    azure_openai = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("azure_openai", {
        env = {
          api_key = "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY",
          endpoint = "YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT",
        },
        schema = {
          model = {
            default = "YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_NAME",
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
  strategies = {
    chat = {
      adapter = "azure_openai",
    },
    inline = {
      adapter = "azure_openai",
    },
  },
}),
```
