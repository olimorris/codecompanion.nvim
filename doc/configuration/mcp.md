# Configuring MCP Servers

In [#2549](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/pull/2549), CodeCompanion added support for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems.

You can find out which parts of the protocol CodeCompanion has implemented on the [MCP Support](/usage/mcp) page.
