CodeCompanion provides an _inline_ strategy for quick, direct interaction with your code. Unlike the chat buffer, the inline assistant integrates responses directly into the current bufferâ€”allowing the LLM to add or replace code as needed.

## Keymaps

The inline assistant supports keymaps for accepting or rejecting changes:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  strategies = {
    inline = {
      keymaps = {
        accept_change = {
          modes = { n = "ga" },
          description = "Accept the suggested change",
        },
        reject_change = {
          modes = { n = "gr" },
          description = "Reject the suggested change",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}),
```

In this example, `<leader>a` (or `ga` on some keyboards) accepts inline changes, while `gr` rejects them.

## Variables

The plugin comes with a number of [variables](/usage/inline-assistant.html#variables) that can be used alongside your prompt. You can also add your own:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  strategies = {
    inline = {
      variables = {
        ["my_new_var"] = {
          ---@return string
          callback = "/Users/Oli/Code/my_var.lua",
          description = "My shiny new variable",
          opts = {
            contains_code = true,
          },
        },
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Layout

If the inline prompt creates a new buffer, you can also customize if this should be output in a vertical/horizontal split or a new buffer:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  display = {
    inline = {
      layout = "vertical", -- vertical|horizontal|buffer
    },
  }
}),
```

## Diff

Please see the [Diff section](chat-buffer#diff) on the Chat Buffer page for configuration options.
