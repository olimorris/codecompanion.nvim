TROUBLESHOOTING                                *codecompanion-troubleshooting*

Before raising an issue
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/issues>, there are a number of
steps you can take to troubleshoot a problem:

**Checkhealth**

Run `:checkhealth codecompanion` and check all dependencies are installed
correctly. Also take note of the log file path.

**Turn on logging**

Update your config and turn debug logging on:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      opts = {
        log_level = "DEBUG", -- or "TRACE"
      }
    })
<

and inspect the log file as per the location from the checkhealth command.

**Try with a minimal.lua file**

A large proportion of issues which are raised in Neovim plugins are to do with
a user’s own config. That’s why I always ask users to fill in a
`minimal.lua` file when they raise an issue. We can rule out their config being
an issue and it allows me to recreate the problem.

For this purpose, I have included a minimal.lua
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/minimal.lua> file in
the repository for you to test out if you’re facing issues. Simply copy the
file, edit it and run neovim with `nvim --clean -u minimal.lua`.
