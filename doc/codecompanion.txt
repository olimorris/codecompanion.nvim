CONFIGURATION                                    *codecompanion-configuration*

Before configuring the plugin, it’s important to understand how it’s
structured.

The plugin uses adapters to connect to LLMs. Out of the box, the plugin
supports:

- Anthropic (`anthropic`) - Requires an API key and supports prompt caching <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching>
- Copilot (`copilot`) - Requires a token which is created via `:Copilot setup` in Copilot.vim <https://github.com/github/copilot.vim>
- Gemini (`gemini`) - Requires an API key
- Ollama (`ollama`) - Both local and remotely hosted
- OpenAI (`openai`) - Requires an API key

The plugin also utilises objects called Strategies. These are the different
ways that a user can interact with the plugin. The _chat_ and _agent_
strategies harness a buffer to allow direct conversation with the LLM. The
_inline_ strategy allows for output from the LLM to be written directly into a
pre-existing Neovim buffer.

The plugin allows you to specify adapters for each strategy and also for each
|codecompanion-default-prompt|.


ADAPTERS ~

Please refer to your chosen adapter
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/lua/codecompanion/adapters>
to understand its configuration. You will need to set an API key for
non-locally hosted LLMs.


  [!TIP] To create your own adapter or better understand how they work, please
  refer to the ADAPTERS <doc/ADAPTERS.md> guide.
**Changing the Default Adapter**

To specify a different adapter to the defaults, simply change the
`strategies.*` table:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      strategies = {
        chat = {
          adapter = "ollama",
        },
        inline = {
          adapter = "ollama",
        },
        agent = {
          adapter = "anthropic",
        },
      },
    })
<

**Setting an API Key**

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        anthropic = function()
          return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("anthropic", {
            env = {
              api_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_1"
            },
          })
        end,
      },
    })
<

In the example above, we’re using the base of the Anthropic adapter but
changing the name of the default API key which it uses.

**Setting an API Key Using a Command**

Having API keys in plain text in your shell is not always safe. Thanks to this
PR <https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/pull/24>, you can run
commands from within your config:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        openai = function()
          return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("openai", {
            env = {
              api_key = "cmd:op read op://personal/OpenAI/credential --no-newline",
            },
          })
        end,
      },
    })
<

In this example, we’re using the 1Password CLI to read an OpenAI credential.

**Using Ollama Remotely**

To use Ollama remotely, simply change the URL in the `env` table:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        ollama = function()
          return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("ollama", {
            env = {
              url = "https://my_ollama_url".
            },
          })
        end,
      },
    })
<

**Configuring Adapter Settings**

LLMs have many settings such as _model_, _temperature_ and _max_tokens_. In an
adapter, these sit within a schema table and can be configured during setup:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        llama3 = function()
          return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("ollama", {
            name = "llama3", -- Ensure the model is differentiated from Ollama
            schema = {
              model = {
                default = "llama3:latest",
              },
              num_ctx = {
                default = 16384,
              },
              num_predict = {
                default = -1,
              },
            },
          })
        end,
      },
    })
<

**Changing the Default Model**

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        anthropic = function()
          return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("anthropic", {
            schema = {
              model = {
                default = "claude-3-opus-20240229",
              },
            },
          })
        end,
      },
    })
<


HIGHLIGHT GROUPS ~

The plugin sets the following highlight groups during setup:

- `CodeCompanionChatHeader` - The headers in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChatSeparator` - Separator between headings in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChatTokens` - Virtual text in the chat buffer showing the token count
- `CodeCompanionChatTool` - Tools in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChatVariable` - Variables in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionVirtualText` - All other virtual text in the plugin


GETTING STARTED                                *codecompanion-getting-started*

**Inline Prompting**

To start interacting with the plugin you can run `:CodeCompanion <your prompt>`
from the command line. You can also make a visual selection in Neovim and run
`:'<,'>CodeCompanion <your prompt>` to send it as context. The plugin will
initially use an LLM to classify your prompt in order to determine where in
Neovim to place the response. You can find more about the classificiations in
the |codecompanion-inline-prompting| section.

For convenience, you can also call |codecompanion-default-prompts| from the
command line via slash commands:

- `/explain` - Explain how selected code in a buffer works
- `/tests` - Generate unit tests for selected code
- `/fix` - Fix the selected code
- `/buffer` - Send the current buffer to the LLM alongside a prompt
- `/lsp` - Explain the LSP diagnostics for the selected code
- `/commit` - Generate a commit message

Running `:'<,'>CodeCompanion /fix` will trigger the plugin to start following
the fix prompt as defined in the config
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/lua/codecompanion/config.lua>.
Some of the slash commands can also take custom prompts. For example, running
`:'<,'>CodeCompanion /buffer refactor this code` sends the whole buffer as
context alongside a prompt to refactor the selected code.

There are also keymaps available to accept or reject edits from the LLM in the
|codecompanion-inline-prompting| section.

**Chat Buffer**

The chat buffer is where you’ll likely spend most of your time when
interacting with the plugin. Running `:CodeCompanionChat` or
`:'<,'>CodeCompanionChat` will open up a chat buffer where you can converse
directly with an LLM. As a convenience, you can use `:CodeCompanionToggle` to
toggle the visibility of a chat buffer.

When in the chat buffer you have access to the following variables:

- `#buffer` - Share the current buffer’s content with the LLM. You can also specify line numbers with `#buffer:8-20`
- `#buffers` - Share all current open buffers with the LLM
- `#editor` - Share the buffers and lines that you see in the editor’s viewport
- `#lsp` - Share LSP information and code for the current buffer


  [!NOTE] When in the chat buffer, the `?` keymap brings up all of the available
  keymaps, variables and tools available to you.
**Agents / Tools**

The plugin also supports LLMs acting as agents by the calling of external
tools. In the video above, we’re asking an LLM to execute the contents of the
buffer via the _@code_runner_ tool, all from within a chat buffer.

When in the chat buffer you have access to the following tools:

- `@code_runner` - The LLM can trigger the running of any code from within a Docker container
- `@rag` - The LLM can browse and search the internet for real-time information to supplement its response
- `@buffer_editor` - The LLM can edit code in a Neovim buffer by searching and replacing blocks


  [!IMPORTANT] Agents are currently at an alpha stage right now and I’m using
  the term agent and tool interchangeably.
**Action Palette**

The `:CodeCompanionActions` command will open the _Action Palette_, giving you
access to all of the functionality in the plugin. The _Prompts_ section is
where the default prompts and your custom ones can be accessed from. You’ll
notice that some prompts have a slash command in their description such as
`/commit`. This enables you to trigger them from the command line by doing
`:CodeCompanion /commit`. Some of these prompts also have keymaps assigned to
them (which can be overwritten!) which offers an even easier route to
triggering them.


  [!NOTE] Some actions will only be visible in the _Action Palette_ if you’re
  in Visual mode.
**List of commands**

Below is a list of commands that are available in the plugin:

- `CodeCompanion` - Inline prompt an LLM
- `CodeCompanion <your prompt>` - Can also inline prompt an LLM like this
- `CodeCompanion /<slash_cmd>` - Inline prompt an LLM with a slash command e.g. `/commit`
- `CodeCompanionChat` - Open up a chat buffer to converse with your LLM
- `CodeCompanionChat <adapter>` - Open up a chat buffer with a specific adapter
- `CodeCompanionToggle` - Toggle a chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionActions` - Open the _Action Palette_
- `CodeCompanionAdd` - Add visually selected chat to the current chat buffer

**Suggested workflow**

For an optimum workflow, I recommend the following options:

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "ga", "<cmd>CodeCompanionAdd<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    
    -- Expand 'cc' into 'CodeCompanion' in the command line
    vim.cmd([[cab cc CodeCompanion]])

ADVANCED USAGE                                  *codecompanion-advanced-usage*


DEFAULT PROMPTS ~

The plugin comes with a number of default prompts (as per the config
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/lua/codecompanion/config.lua>)
which can be called via keymaps and/or slash commands. These prompts have been
carefully curated to mimic those in GitHub’s Copilot Chat
<https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide>.
Of course, you can create your own prompts and add them to the Action Palette
and as slash commands. Please see the RECIPES <doc/RECIPES.md> guide for more
information.


THE CHAT BUFFER ~

The chat buffer is where you converse with an LLM, directly from Neovim. It
behaves as a regular markdown buffer with some clever additions. When the
buffer is written (or "saved"), autocmds trigger the sending of its content to
the LLM in the form of prompts. When a response is received, it is then
streamed back into the buffer.

The chat buffer has been designed to be turn based, whereby the user sends a
message and the LLM replies. Messages are segmented by H2 headers. Once a
message has been sent, it cannot be edited.

As noted in the |codecompanion-getting-started| section, there are a number of
variables that you can make use of whilst in the chat buffer. Use `#` to bring
up the completion menu to see the available options.

**Keymaps**

When in the chat buffer, there are number of keymaps available to you:

- `?` - Bring up the options menu
- `<CR>`|`<C-s>` - Send the buffer to the LLM
- `<C-c>` - Close the buffer
- `q` - Cancel the request from the LLM
- `ga` - Change the adapter
- `gx` - Clear the buffer’s contents
- `gx` - Add a codeblock
- `}` - Move to the next chat
- `{` - Move to the previous chat
- `[` - Move to the next header
- `]` - Move to the previous header

**Settings**

If `display.chat.show_settings` is set to `true`, at the very top of the chat
buffer will be the adapter’s model parameters which can be changed to tweak
the response from the LLM. You can find more detail by moving the cursor over
them.

**Open Chats**

From the Action Palette, the `Open Chats` action enables users to easily
navigate between their open chat buffers. A chat buffer can be deleted (and
removed from memory) by pressing `<C-c>`.


INLINE PROMPTING ~


  [!NOTE] If `send_code = false` then this will take precedent and no code will
  be sent to the LLM
Inline prompts can be triggered via the `CodeCompanion <your prompt>` command.
As mentioned in the |codecompanion-getting-started| section, you can also
leverage visual selections and slash commands like `'<,'>CodeCompanion /buffer
what does this code do?`, where the slash command points to a
|codecompanion-default-prompt| and any words after that act as a custom prompt
to the LLM.

One of the challenges with inline editing is determining how the LLM’s
response should be handled in the buffer. If you’ve prompted the LLM to
_“create a table of 5 common text editors”_ then you may wish for the
response to be placed after the cursor’s position in the current buffer.
However, if you asked the LLM to _“refactor this function”_ then you’d
expect the response to overwrite a visual selection. The plugin will use the
inline LLM you’ve specified in your config to determine if the response
should follow any of the placements below:

- _replace_ - replacing the visual selection
- _add_ - after the visual selection or the cursor
- _new_ - in a new buffer
- _chat_ - in a chat buffer

There are also keymaps available to you after an inline edit has taken place:

- `ga` - Accept an inline edit
- `gr` - Reject an inline edit


AGENTS / TOOLS ~

As outlined by Andrew Ng in Agentic Design Patterns Part 3, Tool Use
<https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-3-tool-use>,
LLMs can act as agents by leveraging external tools. Andrew notes some common
examples such as web searching or code execution that have obvious benefits
when using LLMs.

In the plugin, agents are simply context that’s given to an LLM via a
`system` prompt. This gives it knowledge and a defined schema which it can
include in its response for the plugin to parse, execute and feedback on.
Agents can be added as a participant in a chat buffer by using the `@` key.

More information on how agents work and how you can create your own can be
found in the AGENTS <doc/AGENTS.md> guide.


WORKFLOWS ~


  [!WARNING] Workflows may result in the significant consumption of tokens if
  you’re using an external LLM.
As outlined <https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-242/> by Andrew Ng,
agentic workflows have the ability to dramatically improve the output of an
LLM. Infact, it’s possible for older models like GPT 3.5 to outperform newer
models (using traditional zero-shot inference). Andrew discussed
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc&t=249s> how an agentic workflow
can be utilised via multiple prompts that invoke the LLM to self reflect.
Implementing Andrew’s advice, the plugin supports this notion via the use of
workflows. At various stages of a pre-defined workflow, the plugin will
automatically prompt the LLM without any input or triggering required from the
user.

Currently, the plugin comes with the following workflows:

- Adding a new feature
- Refactoring code

Of course you can add new workflows by following the RECIPES <doc/RECIPES.md>
guide.


EXTRAS                                                  *codecompanion-extras*

**Callbacks**

The plugin has a number of callbacks that can be set in your config and
leveraged in the chat buffer:

>lua
    strategies = {
      chat = {
        -- ...
        callbacks = {
            on_submit = function(chat) end, -- For when a request has been submited
            on_complete = function(chat) end, -- For when a request has completed
        },
      }
    }
<

In each of the callbacks, the chat buffer class is made available via the
`chat` parameter.

**Events/Hooks**

The plugin fires many events during its lifecycle:

- `CodeCompanionChatClosed` - Fired after a chat has been closed
- `CodeCompanionChatAdapter` - Fired after the adapter has been set in the chat
- `CodeCompanionAgentStarted` - Fired when an agent has started using a tool
- `CodeCompanionAgentFinished` - Fired when an agent has finished using a tool
- `CodeCompanionInlineStarted` - Fired at the start of the Inline strategy
- `CodeCompanionInlineFinished` - Fired at the end of the Inline strategy
- `CodeCompanionRequestStarted` - Fired at the start of any API request
- `CodeCompanionRequestFinished` - Fired at the end of any API request


  [!TIP] Some events are sent with a data payload which can be leveraged. Please
  search the codebase for more information.
Events can be hooked into as follows:

>lua
    local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})
    
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
      pattern = "CodeCompanionInline*",
      group = group,
      callback = function(request)
        if request.match == "CodeCompanionInlineFinished" then
          -- Format the buffer after the inline request has completed
          require("conform").format({ bufnr = request.buf })
        end
      end,
    })
<

**Statuslines**

You can incorporate a visual indication to show when the plugin is
communicating with an LLM in your Neovim configuration. Below are examples for
two popular statusline plugins.

_lualine.nvim:_

>lua
    local M = require("lualine.component"):extend()
    
    M.processing = false
    M.spinner_index = 1
    
    local spinner_symbols = {
      "⠋",
      "⠙",
      "⠹",
      "⠸",
      "⠼",
      "⠴",
      "⠦",
      "⠧",
      "⠇",
      "⠏",
    }
    local spinner_symbols_len = 10
    
    -- Initializer
    function M:init(options)
      M.super.init(self, options)
    
      local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})
    
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
        pattern = "CodeCompanionRequest*",
        group = group,
        callback = function(request)
          if request.match == "CodeCompanionRequestStarted" then
            self.processing = true
          elseif request.match == "CodeCompanionRequestFinished" then
            self.processing = false
          end
        end,
      })
    end
    
    -- Function that runs every time statusline is updated
    function M:update_status()
      if self.processing then
        self.spinner_index = (self.spinner_index % spinner_symbols_len) + 1
        return spinner_symbols[self.spinner_index]
      else
        return nil
      end
    end
    
    return M
<

_heirline.nvim:_

>lua
    local CodeCompanion = {
      static = {
        processing = false,
      },
      update = {
        "User",
        pattern = "CodeCompanionRequest*",
        callback = function(self, args)
          if args.match == "CodeCompanionRequestStarted" then
            self.processing = true
          elseif args.match == "CodeCompanionRequestFinished" then
            self.processing = false
          end
          vim.cmd("redrawstatus")
        end,
      },
      {
        condition = function(self)
          return self.processing
        end,
        provider = " ",
        hl = { fg = "yellow" },
      },
    }
<

**Legendary.nvim**

The plugin also supports the amazing legendary.nvim
<https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim> plugin. Simply enable it in
your config:

>lua
    require('legendary').setup({
      extensions = {
        codecompanion = true,
      },
    })
<


TROUBLESHOOTING                                *codecompanion-troubleshooting*

Before raising an issue
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/issues>, there are a number of
steps you can take to troubleshoot a problem:

**Checkhealth**

Run `:checkhealth codecompanion` and check all dependencies are installed
correctly. Also take note of the log file path.

**Turn on logging**

Update your config and turn debug logging on:

>lua
    opts = {
      log_level = "DEBUG", -- or "TRACE"
    }
<

and inspect the log file as per the location from the checkhealth command
(usually `~/.local/state/nvim/codecompanion.log`).
