ADAPTERS ~


  [!WARNING] Depending on your chosen adapter
  <https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/lua/codecompanion/adapters>,
  you may need to set an API key.
The plugin uses adapters to bridge between LLMs and the plugin. Currently the
plugin supports:

- Anthropic (`anthropic`) - Requires an API key
- Ollama (`ollama`)
- OpenAI (`openai`) - Requires an API key

Strategies are the different ways that a user can interact with the plugin. The
_chat_ and _tool_ strategies harness a buffer to allow direct conversation with
the LLM. The _inline_ strategy allows for output from the LLM to be written
directly into a pre-existing Neovim buffer.

To specify a different adapter to the defaults, simply change the
`strategies.*` table:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      strategies = {
        chat = "ollama",
        inline = "ollama",
        tool = "anthropic"
      },
    })
<


  [!TIP] To create your own adapter please refer to the ADAPTERS <ADAPTERS.md>
  guide.

CONFIGURING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

You can customise an adapter’s configuration as follows:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        anthropic = require("codecompanion.adapters").use("anthropic", {
          env = {
            api_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_1"
          },
        }),
      },
      strategies = {
        chat = "anthropic",
        inline = "anthropic",
        tool = "anthropic"
      },
    })
<

In the example above, we’ve changed the name of the default API key which the
Anthropic adapter uses. Having API keys in plain text in your shell is not
always safe. Thanks to this PR
<https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/pull/24>, you can run commands
from within the configuration:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        openai = require("codecompanion.adapters").use("openai", {
          env = {
            api_key = "cmd:op read op://personal/OpenAI/credential --no-newline",
          },
        }),
        strategies = {
          chat = "openai",
          inline = "anthropic",
          tool = "openai"
        },
      },
    })
<

In this example, we’re using the 1Password CLI to read an OpenAI credential.


CONFIGURING ADAPTER SETTINGS

LLMs have many settings such as _model_, _temperature_ and _max_tokens_. In an
adapter, these sit within a schema table and can be configured during setup:

>lua
    require("codecompanion").setup({
      adapters = {
        anthropic = require("codecompanion.adapters").use("anthropic", {
          schema = {
            model = {
              default = "claude-3-sonnet-20240229",
            },
          },
        }),
      },
    })
<


  [!TIP] Refer to your chosen adapter
  <https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/lua/codecompanion/adapters>
  to see the settings available.

EDGY.NVIM CONFIGURATION ~

The author recommends pairing with edgy.nvim
<https://github.com/folke/edgy.nvim> for an experience similar to that of
GitHub’s Copilot Chat:

>lua
    {
      "folke/edgy.nvim",
      event = "VeryLazy",
      init = function()
        vim.opt.laststatus = 3
        vim.opt.splitkeep = "screen"
      end,
      opts = {
        right = {
          { ft = "codecompanion", title = "Code Companion Chat", size = { width = 0.45 } },
        }
      }
    }
<


HIGHLIGHT GROUPS ~

The plugin sets the following highlight groups during setup:

- `CodeCompanionTokens` - Virtual text in the chat buffer showing the token count
- `CodeCompanionVirtualText` - All other virtual text in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionVirtualTextTools` - Virtual text in the chat buffer for when a tool is running


USAGE                                                    *codecompanion-usage*

The plugin has a number of commands:

- `:CodeCompanion` - Inline code writing and refactoring
- `:CodeCompanionWithBuffers` - Inline coding and also sends open buffers to the LLM
- `:CodeCompanionChat` - To open up a new chat buffer
- `:CodeCompanionChat <adapter>` - To open up a new chat buffer with a specific adapter
- `:CodeCompanionAdd` - To add visually selected chat to the current chat buffer
- `:CodeCompanionToggle` - Toggle a chat buffer
- `:CodeCompanionActions` - To open up the action palette window

For an optimum workflow, the plugin author recommendeds the following:

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "ga", "<cmd>CodeCompanionAdd<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
    
    -- Expand `cc` into CodeCompanion in the command line
    vim.cmd([[cab cc CodeCompanion]])
    vim.cmd([[cab ccb CodeCompanionWithBuffers]])
<


  [!NOTE] For some actions, visual mode allows your selection to be sent directly
  to the chat buffer or the LLM (in the case of _inline code_ actions).

THE ACTION PALETTE ~


  [!NOTE] Please see the RECIPES <RECIPES.md> guide in order to add your own
  actions to the palette.
The Action Palette, opened via `:CodeCompanionActions`, contains all of the
actions and their associated strategies for the plugin. It’s the fastest way
to start leveraging CodeCompanion. Depending on whether you’re in _normal_ or
_visual_ mode will affect the options that are available to you in the palette.


THE CHAT BUFFER ~

The chat buffer is where you can converse with the LLM, directly from Neovim.
It behaves as a regular markdown buffer with some clever additions. When the
buffer is written (or "saved"), autocmds trigger the sending of its content to
the LLM in the form of prompts. These prompts are segmented by H1 headers:
`user`, `system` and `assistant`. When a response is received, it is then
streamed back into the buffer. The result is that you experience the feel of
conversing with your LLM from within Neovim.


KEYMAPS

When in the chat buffer, there are number of keymaps available to you:

- `<C-s>` - Save the buffer and trigger a response from the LLM
- `<C-c>` - Close the buffer
- `q` - Cancel the stream from the LLM
- `gc` - Clear the buffer’s contents
- `ga` - Add a codeblock
- `gs` - Save the chat to disk
- `gt` - Add a tool to an existing chat
- `[` - Move to the next header
- `]` - Move to the previous header


SAVED CHATS

Chat buffers are not saved to disk by default, but can be by pressing `gs` in
the buffer. Saved chats can then be restored via the Action Palette and the
_Load saved chats_ action.


SETTINGS

If `display.chat.show_settings` is set to `true`, at the very top of the chat
buffer will be the adapter’s model parameters which can be changed to tweak
the response. You can find more detail about them by moving the cursor over
them.


OPEN CHATS

From the Action Palette, the `Open Chats` action enables users to easily
navigate between their open chat buffers. A chat buffer can be deleted (and
removed from memory) by pressing `<C-c>`.


INLINE CODE ~

You can use the plugin to create inline code directly into a Neovim buffer.
This can be invoked by using the _Action Palette_ (as above) or from the
command line via `:CodeCompanion`. For example:

>
    :CodeCompanion create a table of 5 common text editors and loop through them
<

>
    :'<,'>CodeCompanion refactor the code to make it more concise
<


  [!NOTE] The command can detect if you’ve made a visual selection and send any
  code as context to the LLM alongside the filetype of the buffer.
You can also send the contents of any loaded buffers (which match the current
buffer’s filetype) to the LLM as context:

>
    :CodeCompanionWithBuffers <your request>
<


  [!NOTE] If `send_code = false` then this will take precedent and no buffers
  will be sent to the LLM

OTHER POINTS TO NOTE

One of the challenges with inline editing is determining how the LLM’s
response should be handled in the buffer. If you’ve prompted the LLM to
_“create a table of 5 common text editors”_ then you may wish for the
response to be placed after the cursor’s current position in the buffer.
However, if you asked the LLM to _“refactor this function”_ then you’d
expect the response to overwrite a visual selection. The plugin will use the
inline LLM you’ve specified to determine if the response should follow any of
the placements below:

- _after_ - after the visual selection
- _before_ - before the visual selection
- _cursor_ - one column after the cursor position
- _new_ - in a new buffer
- _replace_ - replacing the visual selection

The strategy comes with a number of helpers via the action palette which the
user can type in the prompt, similar to GitHub Copilot Chat
<https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-30-code-faster-and-better-with-github-copilots-new-features-in-visual-studio/>

- `/doc`to add a documentation comment
- `/optimize` to analyze and improve the running time of the selected code
- `/tests` to create unit tests for the selected code


TOOLS ~


  [!IMPORTANT] Tools are currently at an alpha stage. I’m yet to properly
  battle test them so feedback is much appreciated.
As outlined by Andrew Ng in Agentic Design Patterns Part 3, Tool Use
<https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-3-tool-use>,
LLMs can act as agents by leveraging external tools. Andrew notes some common
examples such as web searching or code execution that have obvious benefits
when using LLMs.

In this plugin, tools are simply context that’s given to an LLM via a
`system` prompt. This gives it knowledge and a defined schema which it can
include in its response for the plugin to parse, execute and feedback on. Tools
can be leveraged by opening up the action palette and choosing the _tools_
option. Or, tools can be added when in an existing chat buffer via the `gt`
keymap.

More information on how tools work and how you can create your own can be found
in the TOOLS <TOOLS.md> guide.


WORKFLOWS ~


  [!WARNING] Workflows may result in the significant consumption of tokens if
  you’re using an external LLM.
As outlined <https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-242/> by Andrew Ng,
agentic workflows have the ability to dramatically improve the output of an
LLM. Infact, it’s possible for older models like GPT 3.5 to outperform newer
models (using traditional zero-shot inference). Andrew discussed
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc&t=249s> how an agentic workflow
can be utilised via multiple prompts that invoke the LLM to self reflect.
Implementing Andrew’s advice, the plugin supports this notion via the use of
workflows. At various stages of a pre-defined workflow, the plugin will
automatically prompt the LLM without any input or triggering required from the
user.

Currently, the plugin comes with the following workflows:

- Adding a new feature
- Refactoring code

Of course you can add new workflows by following the RECIPES <RECIPES.md>
guide.


OTHER ACTIONS ~


  [!NOTE] These actions are only available in visual mode

CODE ADVISOR

As the name suggests, this action provides advice on a visual selection of code
and utilises the `chat` strategy. The response from the LLM is streamed into a
chat buffer which follows the `display.chat` settings in your configuration.


LSP ASSISTANT

Taken from the fantastic Wtf.nvim <https://github.com/piersolenski/wtf.nvim>
plugin, this action provides advice on how to correct any LSP diagnostics which
are present on the visually selected lines. Again, the `send_code = false`
value can be set in your config to prevent the code itself being sent to the
LLM.


HELPERS                                                *codecompanion-helpers*


HOOKS / USER EVENTS ~

The plugin fires the following events during its lifecycle:

- `CodeCompanionRequest` - Fired during the API request. Outputs `data.status` with a value of `started` or `finished`
- `CodeCompanionChatSaved` - Fired after a chat has been saved to disk
- `CodeCompanionChat` - Fired at various points during the chat buffer. Comes with the following attributes:
    - `data.action = hide_buffer` - For when a chat buffer is hidden
    - `data.action = show_buffer` - For when a chat buffer is visible after being hidden
- `CodeCompanionInline` - Fired during the inline API request alongside `CodeCompanionRequest`. Outputs `data.status` with a value of `started` or `finished`
- `CodeCompanionTool` - Fired when a tool is running. Outputs `data.status` with a value of `started` or `success`/`failure`

Events can be hooked into as follows:

>lua
    local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})
    
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
      pattern = "CodeCompanionInline",
      group = group,
      callback = function(request)
        print(request.data.status) -- outputs "started" or "finished"
      end,
    })
<


STATUSLINES ~

You can incorporate a visual indication to show when the plugin is
communicating with an LLM in your Neovim configuration. Below are examples for
two popular statusline plugins.


LUALINE.NVIM

>lua
    local M = require("lualine.component"):extend()
    
    M.processing = false
    M.spinner_index = 1

    }
    local spinner_symbols_len = 10
    
    -- Initializer
    function M:init(options)
      M.super.init(self, options)
    
      local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})
    
      vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
        pattern = "CodeCompanionRequest",
        group = group,
        callback = function(request)
          self.processing = (request.data.status == "started")
        end,
      })
    end
    
    -- Function that runs every time statusline is updated
    function M:update_status()
      if self.processing then
        self.spinner_index = (self.spinner_index % spinner_symbols_len) + 1
        return spinner_symbols[self.spinner_index]
      else
