Workflows can only be initiated from the [Action Palette](/usage/action-palette). This is because they are a complex Lua table structure which needs to be processed and added to a new chat buffer. Simply open up the Action Palette and select your desired workflow.

You can create your own workflows by following the [Creating Workflows](/extending/workflows) guide.
