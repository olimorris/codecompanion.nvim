# Using the Chat Buffer

> [!NOTE]
> The chat buffer has a filetype of `codecompanion` and a buftype of `nofile`

You can open a chat buffer with the `:CodeCompanionChat` command or with `require("codecompanion").chat()`. You can toggle the visibility of the chat buffer with `:CodeCompanionChat Toggle` or `require("codecompanion").toggle()`.

The chat buffer uses markdown as its syntax and `H2` headers separate the user and LLM's responses. The plugin is turn-based, meaning that the user sends a response which is then followed by the LLM's. The user's responses are parsed by [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter) and sent via an adapter to an LLM for a response which is then streamed back into the buffer. A response is sent to the LLM by pressing `<CR>` or `<C-s>`. This can of course be changed as per the [keymaps](#keymaps) section.

## Messages

> [!TIP]
> The message history and adapter settings can be modified via the debug window (`gd`) in the chat buffer

It's important to note that some messages, such as system prompts or context provided via [Slash Commands](/usage/chat-buffer/slash-commands), will be hidden. This is to keep the chat buffer uncluttered from a UI perspective. Using the `gd` keymap opens up the debug window, which allows the user to see the full contents of the messages table which will be sent to the LLM on the next turn.

The message history cannot be altered directly in the chat buffer. However, it can be modified in the debug window. This window is simply a Lua buffer which the user can edit as they wish. To persist any changes, the chat buffer keymaps for sending a message (defaults: `<CR>` or `<C-s>`) can be used.

## Images / Vision

Many LLMs have the ability to receive images as input (sometimes referred to as vision). CodeCompanion supports the adding of images into the chat buffer via the [/image](/usage/chat-buffer/slash-commands#image) slash command and through the system clipboard with [img-clip.nvim](/installation#img-clip-nvim). CodeCompanion can work with images in your file system and also with remote URLs, encoding both into a base64 representation.

If your adapter and model doesn't support images, then CodeCompanion will endeavour to ensure that the image is not included in the messages payload that's sent to the LLM.

## References / Context

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8a31214-ccba-407f-a8e4-32ba185a3ecd" />

Sharing context with an LLM is crucial in order to generate useful responses. In the plugin, references are defined as output that is shared with a chat buffer via a _Variable_, _Slash Command_ or _Agent/Tool_. They appear in a blockquote entitled `Context`. In essence, this is context that you're sharing with an LLM.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> References contain the data of an object at a point in time. By default, they **are not** self-updating

In order to allow for references to self-update, they can be _pinned_ (for files and buffers) or _watched_ (for buffers).

File and buffer references can be _pinned_ to a chat buffer with the `gp` keymap (when your cursor is on the line of the shared buffer in the "> Context section). Pinning results in the content from the object being reloaded and shared with the LLM on every turn. The advantage of this is that the LLM will always receive a fresh copy of the source data regardless of any changes. This can be useful if you're working with agents and tools. However, please note that this can consume a lot of tokens.

Buffer references can be _watched_ via the `gw` keymap (when your cursor is on the line of the shared buffer in the "> Context section). Watching, whilst similar to pinning, is a more token-conscious way of keeping the LLM up to date on the contents of a buffer. Watchers track changes (adds, edits, deletes) in the underlying buffer and update the LLM on each turn, with only those changes.

If a reference is added by mistake, it can be removed from the chat buffer by simply deleting it from the `Context` blockquote. On the next turn, all context related to that reference will be removed from the message history.

Finally, it's important to note that all LLM endpoints require the sending of previous messages that make up the conversation. So even though you've shared a reference once, many messages ago, the LLM will always have that context to refer to.

## Settings

When conversing with an LLM, it can be useful to tweak model settings in between responses in order to generate the perfect output. If settings are enabled (`display.chat.show_settings = true`), then a yaml block will be present at the top of the chat buffer which can be modified in between responses. The yaml block is simply a representation of an adapter's schema table.

## Completion

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02b4d5e2-3b40-4044-8a85-ccd6dfa6d271" />

The plugin supports multiple completion plugins out of the box, in the chat buffer. By default, the plugin will look to setup [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) before trying to setup [nvim-cmp](https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp). If you don't use a completion plugin, then you can use native completions with no setup, invoking them with `<C-_>` from within the chat buffer.

## Keymaps

The plugin has a host of keymaps available in the chat buffer. Pressing `?` in the chat buffer will conveniently display all of them to you.

The keymaps available to the user in normal mode are:

- `<CR>|<C-s>` to send a message to the LLM
- `<C-c>` to close the chat buffer
- `q` to stop the current request
- `ga` to change the adapter for the currentchat
- `gc` to insert a codeblock in the chat buffer
- `gd` to view/debug the chat buffer's contents
- `gf` to fold any codeblocks in the chat buffer
- `gp` to pin a reference to the chat buffer
- `gw` to watch a referenced buffer
- `gr` to regenerate the last response
- `gs` to toggle the system prompt on/off
- `gta` to toggle auto tool mode
- `gx` to clear the chat buffer's contents
- `gy` to yank the last codeblock in the chat buffer
- `[[` to move to the previous header
- `]]` to move to the next header
- `{` to move to the previous chat
- `}` to move to the next chat
