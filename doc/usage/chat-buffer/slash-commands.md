Slash Commands enable you to quickly add context to the chat buffer. They are comprised of values present in the `strategies.chat.slash_commands` table alongside the `prompt_library` table where individual prompts have `opts.is_slash_cmd = true`.

## /buffer

The _buffer_ slash command enables you to add the contents of any open buffers in Neovim to the chat buffer. The command has native, _Telescope_, _mini.pick_ and _fzf.lua_ providers available. Also, multiple buffers can be selected and added to the chat buffer as per the video above.

## /fetch

> [!TIP]
> To better understand a Neovim plugin, send its `config.lua` to your LLM via the _fetch_ command alongside a prompt

The _fetch_ slash command allows you to add the contents of a URL to the chat buffer. By default, the plugin uses the awesome and powerful [jina.ai](https://jina.ai) to parse the page's content and convert it into plain text. For convenience, the slash command will cache the output to disk and prompt the user if they wish to restore from the cache, should they look to fetch the same URL.

## /file

The _file_ slash command allows you to add the contents of a file in the current working directory to the chat buffer. The command has native, _Telescope_, _mini.pick_ and _fzf.lua_ providers available. Also, multiple files can be selected and added to the chat buffer.

## /help

The _help_ slash command allows you to add content from a vim help file (`:h helpfile`), to the chat buffer, by searching for help tags. Currently this is only available for _Telescope_, _mini.pick_ and _fzf_lua_ providers. By default, the slash command will prompt you to trim a help file that is over 1,000 lines in length.

## /now

The _now_ slash command simply inserts the current datetime stamp into the chat buffer.

## /symbols

> [!NOTE]
> If a filetype isn't supported please consider making a PR to add the corresponding Tree-sitter queries from
> [aerial.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/aerial.nvim)

The _symbols_ slash command uses Tree-sitter to create a symbolic outline of a file to share with the LLM. This can be a useful way to minimize token consumption whilst sharing the basic outline of a file. The plugin utilizes the amazing work from **aerial.nvim** by using their Tree-sitter symbol queries. The list of filetypes that the plugin currently supports can be found [here](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/queries).

## /terminal

The _terminal_ slash command shares the output from the last terminal buffer with the chat buffer.

## /workspace

The _workspace_ slash command allows users to share defined groups of files and/or symbols with an LLM, alongside some pre-written context. The slash command uses a [codecompanion-workspace.json](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/codecompanion-workspace.json) file, stored in the current working directory, to house this context. It is, in essence, a context management system for your repository.

Whilst LLMs are incredibly powerful, they have no knowledge of the architectural decisions yourself or your team have made on a project. They have no context as to why you've selected the dependencies that you have. And, they can't see how your codebase has evolved over time.

Please see the [Creating Workspaces](/extending/workspace) guide to learn how to build your own.
