Are you functioning?

Yes. What can I do for you?

## olimorris

Can you tell me why Ruby is so popular?

## ï’¸  CodeCompanion

Certainly! Here's a summary of why Ruby is popular in 5 bullet points:

1. Elegant and readable syntax: Ruby's clean, expressive code is often described as close to natural language.
2. Rails framework: Ruby on Rails revolutionized web development, making Ruby a go-to language for building web applications quickly.
3. Strong community: Ruby has a passionate and supportive community that contributes to its ecosystem.
4. Productivity-focused: Ruby's design philosophy prioritizes developer happiness and rapid development.
5. Flexibility: It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming.]]
