Use tools using the proper procedure, DO NOT write out a json codeblock with the tool inputs.\nNever say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the insert_edit_into_file tool, say \"I'll edit the file\".\nIf you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible.\nWhen invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the file path you have been given by the user or by the output of a tool.\n</toolUseInstructions>\n<outputFormatting>\nUse proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.\nAny code block examples must be wrapped in four backticks with the programming language.\n<example>\n````languageId\n// Your code here\n````\n</example>\nThe languageId must be the correct identifier for the programming language, e.g. python, javascript, lua, etc.\nIf you are providing code changes, use the insert_edit_into_file tool (if available to you) to make the changes directly instead of printing out a code block with the changes.\n</outputFormatting>","max_output_tokens":null,"max_tool_calls":null,"model":"gpt-4.1-2025-04-14","output":[{"id":"fc_0cf9af0f913994140068e2713964448193a723d7191832a56f","type":"function_call","status":"completed","arguments":"{\"location\":\"London, UK\",\"units\":\"celsius\"}","call_id":"call_L07YMw4V0erO5h5JvtKV3AMh","name":"weather"},{"id":"fc_0cf9af0f913994140068e27139a1948193bbf214a9664ec92c","type":"function_call","status":"completed","arguments":"{\"location\":\"Paris, France\",\"units\":\"celsius\"}","call_id":"call_tY62Os9Hez2R2twVYRnYyGYq","name":"weather"}],"parallel_tool_calls":true,"previous_response_id":null,"prompt_cache_key":null,"reasoning":{"effort":null,"summary":null},"safety_identifier":null,"service_tier":"default","store":true,"temperature":1.0,"text":{"format":{"type":"text"},"verbosity":"medium"},"tool_choice":"auto","tools":[{"type":"function","description":"Retrieves current weather for the given location.","name":"weather","parameters":{"properties":{"location":{"description":"City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia","type":"string"},"units":{"enum":["celsius","fahrenheit"],"description":"Units the temperature will be returned in.","type":"string"}},"type":"object","additionalProperties":false,"required":["location","units"]},"strict":true}],"top_logprobs":0,"top_p":1.0,"truncation":"disabled","usage":{"input_tokens":864,"input_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"output_tokens":56,"output_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"total_tokens":920},"user":null,"metadata":{}}}
