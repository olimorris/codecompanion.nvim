            Thanks @${{ github.event.issue.user.login }}. I'll get to this as soon as I can.

            In the meantime, please ensure:

            - This is a plugin related issue and not an issue with your configuration
            - You've searched for similar issues (try the [discussions](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions) too)
            - You've checked out the [documentation](https://codecompanion.olimorris.dev)
            - The tables in your configuration are nested correctly (again, check out the documentation)
            - The issue title is accurate
            - There is a valid `minimal.lua` file included so I can try and recreate the issue
