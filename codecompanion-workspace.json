With tools for variable management, agents, and custom workflows, CodeCompanion.nvim streamlines coding tasks and facilitates intelligent code assistance directly within the Neovim editor.",

The user types their message, saves the buffer and the plugin then uses Tree-sitter to parse the buffer, extracting the contents and sending to an adapter which connects to the user's chosen LLM. The response back from the LLM is streamed into the buffer under another H2 header. The user is then free to respond back to the LLM.\n\nBelow are the relevant files which we will be discussing:\n\n${group_files}",
