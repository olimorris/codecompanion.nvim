The plugin is built around three core strategies: **Chat** (conversational interface), **Inline** (direct code generation), and **Tools** (tool execution).\n\n**Architecture Philosophy:**\n- **Adapter Pattern**: Unified interface for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, etc.)\n- **Strategy Pattern**: Different interaction modes (chat, inline, tools) with shared infrastructure\n- **Builder Pattern**: Complex UI operations broken into composable, testable components\n- **Event-Driven**: Extensible through subscribers, watchers, and workflows\n\n**Key Components:**\n- **Chat Buffer**: Markdown-formatted conversational interface with Tree-sitter parsing\n- **Adapters**: LLM-specific handlers for requests, responses, and capabilities\n- **Tools**: Function calling system for LLM-driven automation\n- **Variables & Context**: Context injection system for enhanced prompts\n- **Workflows**: Automated prompt chaining and response processing\n\n**Testing & Quality:**\nExtensively tested using Mini.Test with both unit tests and visual regression testing through screenshots. The codebase emphasizes maintainability through clear separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and modular design patterns that make extending functionality straightforward.",
