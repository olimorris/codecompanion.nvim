## :zap: Requirements

- The `curl` library installed
- Neovim 0.9.2 or greater
- _(Optional)_ An API key for your chosen LLM

## :package: Installation

Install the plugin with your preferred package manager:

**[Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)**

```lua
{
  "olimorris/codecompanion.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- Optional
    {
      "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Optional: Improves the default Neovim UI
      opts = {},
    },
  },
  config = true
}
```

**[Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)**

```lua
use({
  "olimorris/codecompanion.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("codecompanion").setup()
  end,
  requires = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- Optional
    "stevearc/dressing.nvim" -- Optional: Improves the default Neovim UI
  }
})
```

**[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)**

```vim
call plug#begin()

Plug "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim"
Plug "nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter"
Plug "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" " Optional
Plug "stevearc/dressing.nvim" " Optional: Improves the default Neovim UI
Plug "olimorris/codecompanion.nvim"

call plug#end()

lua << EOF
  require("codecompanion").setup()
EOF
```

## :gear: Configuration

Before configuring the plugin, it's important to understand how it's structured.

The plugin uses adapters to connect to LLMs. Out of the box, the plugin supports:

- Anthropic (`anthropic`) - Requires an API key and supports [prompt caching](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)
- Copilot (`copilot`) - Requires a token which is created via `:Copilot setup` in [Copilot.vim](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim)
- Gemini (`gemini`) - Requires an API key
- Ollama (`ollama`) - Both local and remotely hosted
- OpenAI (`openai`) - Requires an API key

The plugin also utilises objects called Strategies. These are the different ways that a user can interact with the plugin. The _chat_ and _agent_ strategies harness a buffer to allow direct conversation with the LLM. The _inline_ strategy allows for output from the LLM to be written directly into a pre-existing Neovim buffer.

The plugin allows you to specify adapters for each strategy and also for each [default prompt](#clipboard-default-prompts).

### :electric_plug: Adapters

Please refer to your [chosen adapter](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/lua/codecompanion/adapters) to understand its configuration. You will need to set an API key for non-locally hosted LLMs.

> [!TIP]
> To create your own adapter or better understand how they work, please refer to the [ADAPTERS](doc/ADAPTERS.md) guide.

**Changing the Default Adapter**

To specify a different adapter to the default (`openai`), simply change the `strategies.*` table:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  strategies = {
    chat = {
      adapter = "anthropic",
    },
    inline = {
      adapter = "copilot",
    },
    agent = {
      adapter = "anthropic",
    },
  },
})
```

**Setting an API Key**

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    anthropic = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("anthropic", {
        env = {
          api_key = "MY_OTHER_ANTHROPIC_KEY"
        },
      })
    end,
  },
})
```

In the example above, we're using the base of the Anthropic adapter but changing the name of the default API key which it uses.

**Setting an API Key Using a Command**

Having API keys in plain text in your shell is not always safe. Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/pull/24), you can run commands from within your config:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    openai = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("openai", {
        env = {
          api_key = "cmd:op read op://personal/OpenAI/credential --no-newline",
        },
      })
    end,
  },
})
```

In this example, we're using the 1Password CLI to read an OpenAI credential.

**Using Ollama Remotely**

To use Ollama remotely, simply change the URL in the `env` table and set an API key:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    ollama = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("ollama", {
        env = {
          url = "https://my_ollama_url",
          api_key = "OLLAMA_API_KEY",
        },
        headers = {
          ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
          ["Authorization"] = "Bearer ${api_key}",
        },
        parameters = {
          sync = true,
        },
      })
    end,
  },
})
```

**Changing an Adapter's Default Model**

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    anthropic = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("anthropic", {
        schema = {
          model = {
            default = "claude-3-opus-20240229",
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
})
```

**Configuring Adapter Settings**

LLMs have many settings such as _model_, _temperature_ and _max_tokens_. In an adapter, these sit within a schema table and can be configured during setup:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    llama3 = function()
      return require("codecompanion.adapters").extend("ollama", {
        name = "llama3", -- Ensure this adapter is differentiated from Ollama
        schema = {
          model = {
            default = "llama3:latest",
          },
          num_ctx = {
            default = 16384,
          },
          num_predict = {
            default = -1,
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
})
```

**Connecting via a Proxy**

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    opts = {
      --allow_insecure = true,
      proxy = "socks5://127.0.0.1:9999"
    }
  },
})
```

### :art: Highlight Groups

The plugin sets the following highlight groups during setup:

- `CodeCompanionChatHeader` - The headers in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChatSeparator` - Separator between headings in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChatTokens` - Virtual text in the chat buffer showing the token count
- `CodeCompanionChatTool` - Tools in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionChatVariable` - Variables in the chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionVirtualText` - All other virtual text in the plugin

## :rocket: Getting Started

**Inline Prompting**

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->

<div align="center">
  <p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf88836d-832d-4f69-a58e-371bbb8b9bd2</p>
</div>

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->

To start interacting with the plugin you can run `:CodeCompanion <your prompt>` from the command line. You can also make a visual selection in Neovim and run `:'<,'>CodeCompanion <your prompt>` to send it as context. The plugin will initially use an LLM to classify your prompt in order to determine where in Neovim to place the response. You can find more about the classificiations in the [inline prompting](#pencil2-inline-prompting) section below.

[Inline transformations](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/discussions/130) enable you to use the context from a chat buffer in an inline prompt. A prompt such as `:CodeCompanion add the new function here` can leverage the code that the LLM has created in its last response and write it into the current buffer.

For convenience, you can also call [default prompts](#clipboard-default-prompts) from the command line via slash commands:

- `/explain` - Explain how selected code in a buffer works
- `/tests` - Generate unit tests for selected code
- `/fix` - Fix the selected code
- `/buffer` - Send the current buffer to the LLM alongside a prompt
- `/lsp` - Explain the LSP diagnostics for the selected code
- `/commit` - Generate a commit message

Running `:'<,'>CodeCompanion /fix` will trigger the plugin to start following the fix prompt as defined in the [config](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/lua/codecompanion/config.lua). Some of the slash commands can also take custom prompts. For example, running `:'<,'>CodeCompanion /buffer refactor this code` sends the whole buffer as context alongside a prompt to refactor the selected code. If you prompt the LLM with something like `:CodeCompanion why are Lua and Neovim the perfect combination?` then the prompt will be sent to the chat buffer instead.

There are keymaps available to accept or reject edits from the LLM in the [inline prompting](#pencil2-inline-prompting) section.

**Chat Buffer**

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6097fa93-906c-4ed1-b1c4-8b52ad151f9f" alt="Chat buffer"></p>

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->

The chat buffer is where you'll likely spend most of your time when interacting with the plugin. Running `:CodeCompanionChat` or `:'<,'>CodeCompanionChat` will open up a chat buffer where you can converse directly with an LLM. As a convenience, you can use `:CodeCompanionToggle` to toggle the visibility of a chat buffer.

When in the chat buffer you have access to the following variables:

- `#buffer` - Share the current buffer's content with the LLM. You can also specify line numbers with `#buffer:8-20`
- `#buffers` - Share all current open buffers with the LLM
- `#editor` - Share the buffers and lines that you see in the editor's viewport
- `#lsp` - Share LSP information and code for the current buffer

> [!NOTE]
> When in the chat buffer, the `?` keymap brings up all of the available options.

**Agents / Tools**

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->

<div align="center">
  <p>https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bc083c7-f4f1-4eab-b9fe-ab6c4c30ee91</p>
</div>

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->

The plugin also supports LLMs acting as agents by the calling of external tools. In the video above, we're asking an LLM to execute the contents of the buffer via the _@code_runner_ tool, all from within a chat buffer.

When in the chat buffer you have access to the following tools:

- `@code_runner` - The LLM can trigger the running of any code from within a Docker container
- `@rag` - The LLM can browse and search the internet for real-time information to supplement its response
- `@buffer_editor` - The LLM can edit code in a Neovim buffer by searching and replacing blocks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agents are currently at an alpha stage.

**Action Palette**

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-start -->

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23c2ba7c-d438-4132-b13f-11c51ce0a2c5" alt="Action Palette"></p>

<!-- panvimdoc-ignore-end -->

The `:CodeCompanionActions` command will open the _Action Palette_, giving you access to all of the functionality in the plugin. The _Prompts_ section is where the default prompts and your custom ones can be accessed from. You'll notice that some prompts have a slash command in their description such as `/commit`. This enables you to trigger them from the command line by doing `:CodeCompanion /commit`. Some of these prompts also have keymaps assigned to them (which can be overwritten!) which offers an even easier route to triggering them.

> [!NOTE]
> Some actions will only be visible in the _Action Palette_ if you're in Visual mode.

**List of commands**

Below is a list of commands that are available in the plugin:

- `CodeCompanion` - Inline prompt an LLM
- `CodeCompanion <your prompt>` - Can also inline prompt an LLM like this
- `CodeCompanion /<slash_cmd>` - Inline prompt an LLM with a slash command e.g. `/commit`
- `CodeCompanionChat` - Open up a chat buffer to converse with your LLM
- `CodeCompanionChat <adapter>` - Open up a chat buffer with a specific adapter
- `CodeCompanionToggle` - Toggle a chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionActions` - Open the _Action Palette_
- `CodeCompanionAdd` - Add visually selected chat to the current chat buffer

**Suggested workflow**

For an optimum workflow, I recommend the following options:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "ga", "<cmd>CodeCompanionAdd<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Expand 'cc' into 'CodeCompanion' in the command line
vim.cmd([[cab cc CodeCompanion]])
```

## :bulb: Advanced Usage

### :clipboard: Default Prompts

The plugin comes with a number of default prompts ([as per the config](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/lua/codecompanion/config.lua)) which can be called via keymaps and/or slash commands. These prompts have been carefully curated to mimic those in [GitHub's Copilot Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide). Of course, you can create your own prompts and add them to the Action Palette and as slash commands. Please see the [RECIPES](doc/RECIPES.md) guide for more information.

### :speech_balloon: The Chat Buffer

The chat buffer is where you converse with an LLM, directly from Neovim. It behaves as a regular markdown buffer with some clever additions. When the buffer is written (or "saved"), autocmds trigger the sending of its content to the LLM in the form of prompts. When a response is received, it is then streamed back into the buffer.

The chat buffer has been designed to be turn based, whereby the user sends a message and the LLM replies. Messages are segmented by H2 headers. Once a message has been sent, it cannot be edited.

As noted in the [Getting Started](#rocket-getting-started) section, there are a number of variables that you can make use of whilst in the chat buffer. Use `#` to bring up the completion menu to see the available options.

**Keymaps**

When in the chat buffer, there are number of keymaps available to you:

- `?` - Bring up the options menu
- `<CR>`|`<C-s>` - Send the buffer to the LLM
- `<C-c>` - Close the buffer
- `q` - Cancel the request from the LLM
- `gr` - Regenerate the last response from the LLM
- `ga` - Change the adapter
- `gx` - Clear the buffer's contents
- `gx` - Add a codeblock
- `}` - Move to the next chat
- `{` - Move to the previous chat
- `[` - Move to the next header
- `]` - Move to the previous header

**Settings**

If `display.chat.show_settings` is set to `true`, at the very top of the chat buffer will be the adapter's parameters which can be changed to tweak the response from the LLM. You can find more detail by moving the cursor over them.

**Open Chats**

From the Action Palette, the `Open Chats` action enables users to easily navigate between chat buffers. There are also keymaps available in the chat buffer which enable easier navigation.

### :pencil2: Inline Prompting

> [!NOTE]
> If `send_code = false` then this will take precedent and no code will be sent to the LLM

Inline prompts can be triggered via the `CodeCompanion <your prompt>` command. As mentioned in the [Getting Started](#rocket-getting-started) section, you can also leverage chat buffer context, visual selections and slash commands like `'<,'>CodeCompanion /buffer what does this code do?`, where the slash command points to a [default prompt](#clipboard-default-prompts) and any words after that act as a custom prompt to the LLM.

One of the challenges with inline editing is determining how the LLM's response should be handled in the buffer. If you've prompted the LLM to _"create a table of 5 common text editors"_ then you may wish for the response to be placed at the cursor's position in the current buffer. However, if you asked the LLM to _"refactor this function"_ then you'd expect the response to _replace_ a visual selection. The plugin will use the inline LLM you've specified in your config to determine if the response should...

- _replace_ - replace a visual selection you've made
- _add_ - be added in the current buffer at the cursor position
- _new_ - be placed in a new buffer
- _chat_ - be placed in a chat buffer

By default, inline prompting will trigger the diff feature, showing differences between the original buffer and the changes from the LLM. This can be turned off in your config. You an also choose to accept or reject the LLM's suggestions with:

- `ga` - Accept an inline edit
- `gr` - Reject an inline edit

### :robot: Agents / Tools

As outlined by Andrew Ng in [Agentic Design Patterns Part 3, Tool Use](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-3-tool-use), LLMs can act as agents by leveraging external tools. Andrew notes some common examples such as web searching or code execution that have obvious benefits when using LLMs.

In the plugin, agents are simply context that's given to an LLM via a `system` prompt. This gives it knowledge and a defined schema which it can include in its response for the plugin to parse, execute and feedback on. Agents can be added as a participant in a chat buffer by using the `@` key.

More information on how agents work and how you can create your own can be found in the [AGENTS](doc/AGENTS.md) guide.

### :world_map: Workflows

> [!WARNING]
> Workflows may result in the significant consumption of tokens if you're using an external LLM.

As [outlined](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-242/) by Andrew Ng, agentic workflows have the ability to dramatically improve the output of an LLM. Infact, it's possible for older models like GPT 3.5 to outperform newer models (using traditional zero-shot inference). Andrew [discussed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sal78ACtGTc&t=249s) how an agentic workflow can be utilised via multiple prompts that invoke the LLM to self reflect. Implementing Andrew's advice, the plugin supports this notion via the use of workflows. At various stages of a pre-defined workflow, the plugin will automatically prompt the LLM without any input or triggering required from the user.

Currently, the plugin comes with the following workflows:

- Adding a new feature
- Refactoring code

Of course you can add new workflows by following the [RECIPES](doc/RECIPES.md) guide.

## :lollipop: Extras

- `CodeCompanionInlineFinished` - Fired at the end of the Inline strategy
- `CodeCompanionRequestStarted` - Fired at the start of any API request
- `CodeCompanionRequestFinished` - Fired at the end of any API request

> [!TIP]
> Some events are sent with a data payload which can be leveraged. Please search the codebase for more information.

Events can be hooked into as follows:

```lua
local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
  pattern = "CodeCompanionInline*",
  group = group,
  callback = function(request)
    if request.match == "CodeCompanionInlineFinished" then
      -- Format the buffer after the inline request has completed
      require("conform").format({ bufnr = request.buf })
    end
  end,
})
```

**Statuslines**

You can incorporate a visual indication to show when the plugin is communicating with an LLM in your Neovim configuration. Below are examples for two popular statusline plugins.

_lualine.nvim:_

```lua
local M = require("lualine.component"):extend()

M.processing = false
M.spinner_index = 1

local spinner_symbols = {
  "⠋",
  "⠙",
  "⠹",
  "⠸",
  "⠼",
  "⠴",
  "⠦",
  "⠧",
  "⠇",
  "⠏",
}
local spinner_symbols_len = 10

-- Initializer
function M:init(options)
  M.super.init(self, options)

  local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})

  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
    pattern = "CodeCompanionRequest*",
    group = group,
    callback = function(request)
      if request.match == "CodeCompanionRequestStarted" then
        self.processing = true
      elseif request.match == "CodeCompanionRequestFinished" then
        self.processing = false
      end
    end,
  })
end

-- Function that runs every time statusline is updated
function M:update_status()
  if self.processing then
    self.spinner_index = (self.spinner_index % spinner_symbols_len) + 1
    return spinner_symbols[self.spinner_index]
  else
    return nil
  end
end

return M
```

_heirline.nvim:_

```lua
local CodeCompanion = {
  static = {
    processing = false,
  },
  update = {
    "User",
    pattern = "CodeCompanionRequest*",
    callback = function(self, args)
      if args.match == "CodeCompanionRequestStarted" then
        self.processing = true
      elseif args.match == "CodeCompanionRequestFinished" then
        self.processing = false
      end
      vim.cmd("redrawstatus")
    end,
  },
  {
    condition = function(self)
      return self.processing
    end,
    provider = " ",
    hl = { fg = "yellow" },
  },
}
```

**Legendary.nvim**

The plugin also supports the amazing [legendary.nvim](https://github.com/mrjones2014/legendary.nvim) plugin. Simply enable it in your config:

```lua
require('legendary').setup({
  extensions = {
    codecompanion = true,
  },
})
```

## :toolbox: Troubleshooting

Before raising an [issue](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/issues), there are a number of steps you can take to troubleshoot a problem:

**Checkhealth**

Run `:checkhealth codecompanion` and check all dependencies are installed correctly. Also take note of the log file path.

**Turn on logging**

Update your config and turn debug logging on:

```lua
opts = {
  log_level = "DEBUG", -- or "TRACE"
}
```

and inspect the log file as per the location from the checkhealth command (usually `~/.local/state/nvim/codecompanion.log`).
