</details>

### Adapters

> [!WARNING]
> Depending on your [chosen adapter](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/tree/main/lua/codecompanion/adapters), you may need to set an API key.

The plugin uses adapters to bridge between generative AI services and the plugin. Currently the plugin supports:

- Anthropic (`anthropic`) - Requires an API key
- Ollama (`ollama`)
- OpenAI (`openai`) - Requires an API key

You can specify an adapter for each of the strategies in the plugin:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    chat = "anthropic",
    inline = "openai"
  },
})
```

You may need to modify certain parameters of an adapter. In the example below, we're changing the name of the API key that the OpenAI adapter uses by passing in a table to the `use` method:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    chat = require("codecompanion.adapters").use("openai", {
      env = {
        api_key = "DIFFERENT_OPENAI_KEY",
      },
    }),
  },
})
```

> [!TIP]
> To create your own adapter please refer to the [ADAPTERS](ADAPTERS.md) guide.

#### Additional API Key Options

Having API keys in plain text in your shell is not always safe. Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/pull/24), you can run commands from within the plugin:

```lua
require("codecompanion").setup({
  adapters = {
    chat = require("codecompanion.adapters").use("openai", {
      env = {
        api_key = "cmd:gpg --decrypt ~/.openai-api-key.gpg 2>/dev/null",
      },
    }),
  },
})
```

In this example, we're using `gpg` to decrypt a file to obtain an API key.

### Edgy.nvim Configuration

The author recommends pairing with [edgy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/edgy.nvim) for an experience similar to that of GitHub's Copilot Chat:

```lua
{
  "folke/edgy.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  init = function()
    vim.opt.laststatus = 3
    vim.opt.splitkeep = "screen"
  end,
  opts = {
    right = {
      { ft = "codecompanion", title = "Code Companion Chat", size = { width = 0.45 } },
    }
  }
}
```

### Highlight Groups

The plugin sets the following highlight groups during setup:

- `CodeCompanionTokens` - Virtual text showing the token count when in a chat buffer
- `CodeCompanionVirtualText` - All other virtual text in the chat buffer

## :rocket: Usage

The plugin has a number of commands:

- `:CodeCompanion` - Inline code writing and refactoring
- `:CodeCompanionChat` - To open up a new chat buffer
- `:CodeCompanionToggle` - Toggle a chat buffer
- `:CodeCompanionActions` - To open up the action palette window

For an optimum workflow, the plugin author recommendeds the following:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<C-a>", "<cmd>CodeCompanionActions<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("n", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("v", "<LocalLeader>a", "<cmd>CodeCompanionToggle<cr>", { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- Expand `cc` into CodeCompanion in the command line
vim.cmd([[cab cc CodeCompanion]])
```

> [!NOTE]
> For some actions, visual mode allows your selection to be sent directly to the chat buffer or the API itself (in the case of _inline code_ actions).

### The Action Palette

<p><img src="https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/assets/9512444/b5e2ad2d-c6a2-45a4-a4d0-c118dfaec943" alt="action selector" /></p>

> [!NOTE]
> Please see the [RECIPES](RECIPES.md) guide in order to add your own actions to the palette.

The Action Palette, opened via `:CodeCompanionActions`, contains all of the actions and their associated strategies for the plugin. It's the fastest way to start leveraging CodeCompanion. Depending on whether you're in _normal_ or _visual_ mode will affect the options that are available to you in the palette.

> [!TIP]
> If you wish to turn off the default actions, set `use_default_actions = false` in your config.

### The Chat Buffer

<p><img src="https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/assets/9512444/84d5e03a-0b48-4ffb-9ca5-e299d41171bd" alt="chat buffer" /></p>

The chat buffer is where you can converse with the generative AI service, directly from Neovim. It behaves as a regular markdown buffer with some clever additions. When the buffer is written (or "saved"), autocmds trigger the sending of its content to the generative AI service in the form of prompts. These prompts are segmented by H1 headers: `user`, `system` and `assistant`. When a response is received, it is then streamed back into the buffer. The result is that you experience the feel of conversing with your generative AI service from within Neovim.

#### Keymaps

When in the chat buffer, there are number of keymaps available to you:

- `<C-s>` - Save the buffer and trigger a response from the generative AI service
- `<C-c>` - Close the buffer
- `q` - Cancel the stream from the API
- `gc` - Clear the buffer's contents
- `ga` - Add a codeblock
- `gs` - Save the chat to disk
- `[` - Move to the next header
- `]` - Move to the previous header

#### Saved Chats

Chat buffers are not saved to disk by default, but can be by pressing `gs` in the buffer. Saved chats can then be restored via the Action Palette and the _Load saved chats_ action.

#### Settings

If `display.chat.show_settings` is set to `true`, at the very top of the chat buffer will be the adapter's model parameters which can be changed to tweak the response. You can find more detail about them by moving the cursor over them.

### Inline Code

https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/assets/9512444/0a448d12-5b8b-4932-b2e9-871eec45c534

You can use the plugin to create inline code directly into a Neovim buffer. This can be invoked by using the _Action Palette_ (as above) or from the command line via `:CodeCompanion`. For example:

```
:CodeCompanion create a table of 5 fruits
```

```
:'<,'>CodeCompanion refactor the code to make it more concise
```

> [!NOTE]
> The command can detect if you've made a visual selection and send any code as context to the API alongside the filetype of the buffer.

One of the challenges with inline editing is determining how the generative AI's response should be handled in the buffer. If you've prompted the API to _"create a table of 5 fruits"_ then you may wish for the response to be placed after the cursor's current position in the buffer. However, if you asked the API to _"refactor this function"_ then you'd expect the response to overwrite a visual selection. If this placement isn't specified then the plugin will use generative AI itself to determine if the response should follow any of the placements below:

- _after_ - after the visual selection
- _before_ - before the visual selection
- _cursor_ - one column after the cursor position
- _new_ - in a new buffer
- _replace_ - replacing the visual selection

As a final example, specifying a prompt like _"create a test for this code in a new buffer"_ would result in a new Neovim buffer being created.

### In-Built Actions

The plugin comes with a number of [in-built actions](https://github.com/olimorris/codecompanion.nvim/blob/main/lua/codecompanion/actions.lua) which aim to improve your Neovim workflow. Actions make use of either a _chat_ or an _inline_ strategy. The chat strategy opens up a chat buffer whilst an inline strategy will write output from the generative AI service into the Neovim buffer.

#### Chat and Chat as

> [!TIP]
> Both of these actions allow for visually selected code to be sent to the chat buffer as code blocks.

Both of these actions utilise the `chat` strategy. The `Chat` action opens up a fresh chat buffer. The `Chat as` action allows for persona based context to be set in the chat buffer allowing for better and more detailed responses from the generative AI service.

#### Open chats

This action enables users to easily navigate between their open chat buffers. A chat buffer can be deleted (and removed from memory) by pressing `<C-c>`.

#### Agentic Workflows

> [!WARNING]
> Agentic workflows may result in the significant consumption of tokens if you're using an external generative AI service.

As outlined in Andrew Ng's [tweet](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg/status/1773393357022298617), agentic workflows have the ability to dramatically improve the output of an LLM and can be as simple as prompting an LLM multiple times. The plugin supports this via the use of workflows. At various stages of the workflow, the plugin will automatically prompt the LLM for feedback and self-reflection without any input from the user.

Currently, the plugin only supports _"reflection"_ (multiple prompts within the same application) and comes with the following workflows:

- Adding a new feature
- Refactoring code

Of course you can add new workflows by following the [RECIPES](RECIPES.md) guide.

#### Inline code

> [!NOTE]
> The options available to the user in the Action Palette will depend on the Vim mode.

These actions utilize the `inline` strategy. They can be useful for writing inline code in a buffer or even refactoring a visual selection; all based on a user's prompt. The actions are designed to write code for the buffer filetype that it is initated in, or, if run from a terminal prompt, to write commands.

The strategy comes with a number of helpers which the user can type in the prompt, similar to [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-01-30-code-faster-and-better-with-github-copilots-new-features-in-visual-studio/):

- `/doc` to add a documentation comment
- `/optimize` to analyze and improve the running time of the selected code
- `/tests` to create unit tests for the selected code


#### Code advisor

> [!NOTE]
> This option is only available in visual mode

As the name suggests, this action provides advice on a visual selection of code and utilises the `chat` strategy. The response from the API is streamed into a chat buffer which follows the `display.chat` settings in your configuration.

#### LSP assistant

> [!NOTE]
> This option is only available in visual mode

Taken from the fantastic [Wtf.nvim](https://github.com/piersolenski/wtf.nvim) plugin, this action provides advice on how to correct any LSP diagnostics which are present on the visually selected lines. Again, the `send_code = false` value can be set in your config to prevent the code itself being sent to the generative AI service.

## :rainbow: Helpers

### Hooks / User events

The plugin fires the following events during its lifecycle:

- `CodeCompanionRequest` - Fired during the API request. Outputs `data.status` with a value of `started` or `finished`
- `CodeCompanionChatSaved` - Fired after a chat has been saved to disk
- `CodeCompanionChat` - Fired at various points during the chat buffer. Comes with the following attributes:
  - `data.action = close_buffer` - For when a chat buffer has been permanently closed
  - `data.action = hide_buffer` - For when a chat buffer is hidden
  - `data.action = show_buffer` - For when a chat buffer is visible after being hidden
- `CodeCompanionInline` - Fired during the inline API request alongside `CodeCompanionRequest`. Outputs `data.status` with a value of `started` or `finished`

Events can be hooked into as follows:

```lua
local group = vim.api.nvim_create_augroup("CodeCompanionHooks", {})

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({ "User" }, {
  pattern = "CodeCompanionInline",
  group = group,
  callback = function(request)
    print(request.data.status) -- outputs "started" or "finished"
  end,
})
```

> [!TIP]
> A possible use case is for formatting the buffer after an inline code request

### Heirline.nvim

If you're using the fantastic [Heirline.nvim](https://github.com/rebelot/heirline.nvim) plugin, consider the following snippet to display an icon in the statusline whilst CodeCompanion is conversing with a generative AI service:

```lua
local CodeCompanion = {
  static = {
    processing = false,
  },
  update = {
    "User",
    pattern = "CodeCompanionRequest",
    callback = function(self, args)
      self.processing = (args.data.status == "started")
      vim.cmd("redrawstatus")
    end,
  },
  {
    condition = function(self)
      return self.processing
    end,
    provider = " ",
    hl = { fg = "yellow" },
  },
}
```
